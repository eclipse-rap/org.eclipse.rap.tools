  <h1>RAP look and feel</h1>
  <p>
  <i><strong>Note:</strong> This is about the interaction design API for the workbench, not the <a href = "theming.html">theming</a> API
  that controls the look of specific widgets.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    RAP provides an additional API to change the look and feel of workbench applications.
    This article is a step-by-step guide to using the so-called “interaction
    design API” to control the look of the WorkbenchWindow. All look and feel artifacts
    can be bundled into a separate plug-in and contributed to an existing application
    without touching the application itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's have a look at a RAP application with a customized look and feel:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="../images/interactiondesign/newLook.png" alt="RAP Application with Business theming"/>
  </p>

  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <p>
    These are the elements that we will be working with.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      WorkbenchWindow components such as the ToolBar, MenuBar and the ViewToolbar.
    </li>
    <li>
      Presentations for Stacks or, in other words, the look and feel of views and
      editors. You'll see later how the interaction design API allows you to make
      stack independent changes on-the-fly.
    </li>
    <li>
      The graphical layout. When you change the look and feel of an application, you
      generally also need to change elements in the graphical layout, such as moving
      a menubar or the perspective switcher, or selecting a different font.
    </li>
    <li>
      Activation by servlet name. You can leverage the servlets in RAP and use the
      servlet name to access the whole layout from a single point.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reusable web components. Elements such as the header for an application are
      very likely to be reused in their web versions. Layout information can also be
      reused for web components. So a developer has not to develop many different
      web components, he can use the technique described bellow to create a component
      which can be reused in many applications.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Finally, one additional but important requirement for a good look and feel is
    to change interaction concepts to match the new UI. To assist in this, the API
    provides an automatic service called personalization. For instance it hides all
    ViewActions by default and makes it's visibility customizable.
  </p>

  <h2>WorkbenchWindow components</h2>
  <p>
    The best place to start is to create a PresentationFactory. You will need to
    create an extension for the <em>org.eclipse.ui.presentationFactories</em>
    extension point.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="../images/interactiondesign/presentationFactoryExt.png" alt="PresentationFactory Extensions"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is the same as it appears in the plugin.xml.
  </p>
  <pre class="lang-xml">
&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.ui.presentationFactories"&gt;
  &lt;factory
    class="org.eclipse.rap.presentation.example.PresentationFactoryImpl"
    id="org.eclipse.rap.presentation"
    name="RAP Presentation"&gt;
  &lt;/factory&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</pre>

  <p>
    The presentationFactory contains the following attributes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>class</b><br/>
      The class refers to an implementation of
      <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.PresentationFactory</em>. It is
      very important not to extend from the original
      <em>org.eclipse.ui.presentation.AbstractPresentationFactory</em> as this
      class does not support the concepts described here.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>name</b><br/>
      A human readable name for the PresentationFacotry implementation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.PresentationFactory</em> is
    abstract, so you will need to implement its abstract methods. Most are create
    methods for different Managers, for example, the MenuBar MenuManager or the
    Manager for the ToolBar. A ToolBar or MenuBar manager is a contribution manager
    which  realizes itself and its items in a control. In these implementations you can
    change the look of the components such as styling a toolbar with icons and text
    or making it transparent.
  </p>

  <h2>Presentations for Stacks</h2>
  <p>
    If you are not familiar with the original AbstractPresentationFactory you might
    consider reading up on StackPresentations. You'll find a basic overview of the
    partstack in the
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-UI-Workbench/workbench.html">
    Inside the Workbench</a> article.
    <br/>
    The look and feel of a partstack can be changed using StackPresentations. In the
    previous PresentationFactory the presentation had to be implemented
    programmatically. The interaction design API allows you to declare
    StackPresentations as an extension for the extension point
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.stackPresentations</em>.<br/>
    <img src="../images/interactiondesign/stackPresentationExt.png" alt="StackPresentation Extension"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is the same as it appears in the plugin.xml.
  </p>
  <pre class="lang-xml">
&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.rap.ui.stackPresentations"&gt;
  &lt;stackPresentation
    id="org.eclipse.rap.presentation.macBarStackPresentation"
    class="org.eclipse.rap.presentation.example.stacks.MacBarStackPresentation"
    name="MacBar"
    type="view"
    actionClass="org.eclipse.rap.presentation.example.configaction.ExampleConfigAction"
    actionIcon="icons/configAction.png"
    menuIcon="icons/menuIcon.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/stackPresentation&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    <b>stackPresentation</b> contain the following attributes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>class</b><br/>
      To be backward compatible with Eclipse 3.4 or earlier, you can
      implement <em>org.eclipse.ui.presentation.StackPresentation</em>. But to use
      all the features of the interaction design API the
      <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.ConfigurableStack</em>. should be
      implemented. The ConfigurableStack is an abstract class and provides additional
      methods i.e. to get the part's ToolbarManager. <br/>
      The parts ToolbarManager contains all the actions of the parts toolbar and adds
      the personalization features. To create a clean UI all actions are invisible,
      but this visibility can be changed by the user during runtime. <br/>
      Another benefit of the ConfigurableStack is the ability to change the
      look of the stack during runtime without reloading the whole
      application. Therefore it provides a method called
      <em>setCurrentStackPresentation( String id )</em>. The id should be the id
      of the presentation defined in the extension. When you call this method, you
      will change the presentation of a whole stack to the presentation defined with
      the given id. The reloading happens automatically.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>type</b><br/>
      There are three types of stacks. Editor-, view- and standaloneViewStacks. You
      can define a presentation for a specific type using the following arguments:
      view, standaloneView, editor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>actionClass</b><br/>
      This should be an implementation of
      <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.ConfigurationAction</em>. This is
      an abstract class providing methods for personalization. For example, you can
      use this to implement a popup dialog which allows the user to configure
      viewaction visibility or the stack's presentation. To apply configuration
      changes in your ConfigurableStack you will need to implement the Interface
      <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.IConfigurationChangedListener</em>
      and register it in the ConfigurationAction.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>actionIcon</b><br/>
      A ConfigurationAction can contain an icon which can be used i.e. as a button's
      icon. The icon is associated with the <em>ConfigurationAction</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>menuIcon</b><br/>
      This is the icon for the view's menu and can be used to replace the standard
      triangle. To access this image use the <em>getMenuIcon()</em> Method inside
      the ConfigurableStack.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The graphical layout</h2>
  <p>
    RAP provides the ability to define graphical layouts where you have control over
    the elements  such as the position of the workbench components like the toolbar,
    menubar or the perspective switcher. The WorkbenchWindowAdvisors
    <em>createWindowContents( Shell )</em> method is one method, but the
    result of this technique is a fixed coupling between the look and feel and your
    application code. <br/>
    You can now separate the application code and the look and feel by using the
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.IWindowComposer</em> Interface. An
    implementation of
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.PresentationFactory</em> defines
    the method <em>createWindowComposer()</em> which is called within the
    WorkbenchWindow.  This is a simple replacement for the advisor's method that
    results in a loose coupling between application elements. <br/>
    In order to organize graphical layout information such as images, colors, fonts
    and position data, the following registry was created.
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.layout.LayoutRegistry</em><br/>
    The LayoutRegistry is a singleton object which contains all existing layouts
    represented by <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.model.Layout</em>
    and <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.model.LayoutSet</em>.
    A Layout can be declared by creating an extension for the extension point
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.layouts</em>.<br/>
    <img src="../images/interactiondesign/layoutExt.png" alt="Layout extension"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    And here is the same as it appears in the plugin.xml.
  </p>
<pre class="lang-xml">
&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.rap.ui.layouts"&gt;
  &lt;layout
    id="org.eclipse.presentation.example.layout"
    name="Example Layout"&gt;
      &lt;layoutSet
        class="org.eclipse.rap.presentation.example.layoutset.HeaderLayoutSet2"
        id="header.layoutset"
        name="Header2"&gt;
      &lt;/layoutSet&gt;
  &lt;/layout&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    Layout contains the following attributes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>id</b><br/>
      This id can be used to get a Layout object from the LayoutRegistry.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>name</b><br/>
      A human readable name for this layout.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Every Layout can have multiple layoutSets:<br/>
    <b>Element layoutSet</b><br/>
    A layoutSet is a representation of the following class:
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.layout.model.LayoutSet</em>. The
    object contains the information described above. Every layoutSet has a
    maximum of one Layout as a parent and has the following attributes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>id</b><br/>
      This id can be used to get a LayoutSet object from a Layout using the
      <em>getLayoutSet( String id )</em> method.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>class</b><br/>
      This should be an implementation of the following interface: <br/>
      <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.layout.ILayoutSetInitializer</em>.
      This interface contains one method which is used to declared layout information
      for a LayoutSet object. All IlayoutSetInitializers will be called during the
      LayoutRegistry initialization.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>overridesId</b><br/>
      This optional attribute should be an existing LayoutSet id. It's value will be
      used to override a LayoutSet. This is useful i.e. if a bundle defines a LayoutSet
      which contributes a Logo. Than another bundle can override this LayoutSet and
      contribute it's own logo.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following is an example use case for a declarative layout. <br/>
    A button should display its text in a specific font. Instead of defining the
    font directly in the source code, you can define a layout and a layoutSet over
    the extension described above. Let start by creating two id's. <br/>
    For the Layout = <em>org.eclipse.layout</em><br/>
    For the layoutSet = <em>org.eclipse.layoutSet</em><br/>
    To define the font you can call the
    <em>LayoutSet.addFont( String key, Font font )</em> method in your
    IlayoutSetInitializer implementation. We use "fontKey" as the key value. Here
    is the source code for this font definition:
  </p>
  <pre class="lang-java">
Button button = new Button( composite, SWT.NONE );
LayoutRegistry registry = LayoutRegistry.getInstance();
registry.setActiveLayout( "org.eclipse.layout" );
Layout layout = registry.getActiveLayout();
LayoutSet set = layout.getLayoutSet( "org.eclipse.layoutSet" );
button.setFont( set.getFont( "fontKey" );</pre>
  <p>
    An alternative to accomplish this is theming, but the declarative layout give
    you more options such as defining images or position data. Another big advantage
    of using the declarative layout is that you can change a layout during runtime.
    And, to do this is just a two step process.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
    Define two layouts with layoutSets. The layoutSets must have the same ids as in
    their equivalent and the key values for the information need to be identical.
    </li>
    <li>
    Call the <em>setActiveLayout( String id )</em> method within the
    LayoutRegistry. This sets the active layout to the one with the given id.
    The PresentationFactory will be called automatically and prompt a rebuild of the
    styled components.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Activation by servlet name</h2>
  <p>
    Different layouts can be activated from a central point by using the servlet name.
    To activate a PresentationFactory and a Layout by a servlet name, you can use the
    <a href="branding.html"><em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.branding</em> extension point</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="../images/interactiondesign/brandingExt.png" alt="Branding extension"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    And here is the same as it appears in the plugin.xml.
  </p>
  <pre class="lang-xml">
&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.rap.ui.branding"&gt;
  &lt;branding
    defaultEntrypointId="org.eclipse.rap.demo.entrypoint1"
    favicon="icons/perspective.gif"
    id="org.eclipse.rap.presentation.macBarBranding"
    servletName="api"
    themeId="org.eclipse.rap.presentation.macBarTheme"
    title="Interactiondesign API"&gt;
    &lt;presentationFactory
      defaultLayoutId="org.eclipse.rap.presentation.defaultlayout"
      id="org.eclipse.rap.presentation"
      name="ConfigurablePF"&gt;
      viewactionsVisible=true;
      &lt;defaultStackPresentation
        id="org.eclipse.rap.presentation.navigationPaneStackPresentation"
        name="Default"&gt;
      &lt;/defaultStackPresentation&gt;
      &lt;stackPresentation
        id="org.eclipse.rap.presentation.macBarStackPresentation"
        name="topLeftMapping"
        partId="topLeft"&gt;
      &lt;/stackPresentation&gt;
    &lt;/presentationFactory&gt;
  &lt;/branding&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    As you can see, the presentationFactory is an element of the branding extension and has the
    following attributes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>id</b><br/>
      This is the id of the PresentationFactory which should be loaded when the
      servlet name defined in the branding has been called.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>defaultLayoutId</b><br/>
      This optional argument represents the id of the Layout which should be activated
      when the servlet name has been called. If no id is defined, the standard workbench
      layout should be loaded.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>viewActionsVisible</b><br/>
      This boolean value is responsible for making all view contribution items
      visible by default (true) or to let the user decide which items are
      visible (false).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The presentationFactory element can have two different sub elements.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>defaultStackPresentation</b><br/>
      This represents the StackPresentation which is loaded for all parts if nothing
      else is defined. You need to specify the id of the StackPresentation if a
      different presentation should be loaded.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>stackPresentation</b><br/>
      This element couples a stackPresentation to a specific part. The id attribute
      should be the id of the stackPresentation to load. The partId represents the id
      of a part which has been defined in a perspective.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Reusable web components</h2>
  <p>
    To style the look and feel of a RAP application many web components are also
    required. For example, you may want to place the menubar on a header with
    rounded corners or place the statusline in a nicely styled footer. You can
    accomplish this with SWT Widgets but if you want to reuse these components,
    you'll need to use also
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.layout.ElementBuilder</em>. An
    ElementBuilder is an abstract class which works hand in hand with the
    declarative layout. You can extend it to build your own web components.<br/>
    This is a two step process.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Extend <em>org.eclipse.rap.ui.interactiondesign.ElementBuilder</em> and
      implement its abstract methods. The most important method is
      <em>build()</em>. You should build your component with SWT widgets when
      <em>build()</em> is called. Every ElementBuilder is associated to a LayoutSet
      id which will get from the LayoutRegsitry during the instantiation of the
      ElementBuilder. During the instantiation the builder register itself in the
      LayoutRegistry. If a new Layout is activated the <em>dispose()</em> methods
      from all registered ElementBuilders will be called. This means that you need to
      be sure you dispose your component correctly in this method. If not, switching the
      Layout on-the-fly may not work correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
      The second step is to instantiate an ElementBuilder.  As an example, YourBuilder
      is instantiated by the following snippet:
      <pre class="lang-java">
Composite parent = new Composite( aShell, SWT.NONE );
ElementBuilder builder = new YourBuilder( parent, "org.eclipse.layoutSet" );</pre>
      Be sure that your ElementBuilder implementation is initialized with a layoutSet
      you've associated with it.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    You may recognize the idea behind the ElementBuilder - it is based on the
    builder design pattern. This separates the component from your application
    code allowing you to reuse the component in different places.
  </p>
  <p>
    This completes our tour of the interaction design API. For questions please
    feel free to ask in the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/eclipse.technology.rap">
    RAP forum</a>. We'd also be glad to hear about your experiences with this
    API and to have a look at the great new look and feels you're building for
    your apps.
