  <h1>Tree and Table Enhancements</h1>

   <p>
     <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Tree.html">Tree</a></em>
     and
     <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Table.html">Table</a></em>
     are the most powerful widgets in RAP. Not only can they easily display
     vast amounts of data (thanks to JFace and virtual rendering) in various ways, they also feature
     some additional functionality in RAP compared to their SWT counterparts.
   </p>
   <p>The following is a list of hints you might find helpful when working with Tree or Table.</p>

   <h3 id="jface" >JFace support:</h3>
   <p>
     RAP includes it's own JFace implementation that can be used
     to sort, filter and edit data in Trees and Tables.
     Simply create Tree/Table
     <a href="/help/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/jface_viewers.htm">viewers</a>
     instead of the widget itself. RAP-specific features can still be enabled by accessing the widget
     within the viewer directly.
      Example:
   </p>
   <pre class="lang-java">viewer.getTable().setData( RWT.MARKUP_ENABLED, Boolean.TRUE );</pre>

    <h3 id="fixedcolumns">Fixed Columns:</h3>
    <p>
      When a table or tree displays many columns, the user often has to scroll horizontally to see
      specific data.
      Doing so means losing sight of the first columns, which may contain vital information that
      should be visible at all times.
      Using
      <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/RWT.html#FIXED_COLUMNS">RWT.FIXED_COLUMNS</a></em>,
      it is possible to exclude any number of leftmost
      columns from scrolling, so that they always stick on the left border of the tree or table.<br/>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre class="lang-java">tree.setData( RWT.FIXED_COLUMNS, new Integer( 1 ) );</pre>

    <h3 id="markup">Markup Support:</h3>
    <p>
      You can greatly enhance the look and interactivity
      of any Tree or Table using the RAP
      <a href="markup.html#markup">markup feature</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="break">Line breaks in Columns:</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike SWT, RAP supports line breaks ( <q>\n</q> ) in a columns text property.
    </p>

    <h3 id="virtual">Virtual rendering and performance:</h3>
    <p>
      There are two ways Tree and Table support virtual rendering. First, any tree/table will
      only render HTML for the data that is currently visible on screen. (Unlike <em>List</em>,
      which always renders it's entire content.)
      Second, if the widget (or viewer) is created with a
      <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/SWT.html#VIRTUAL">VIRTUAL</a></em>
      flag, items can be created lazily. As a result, data that is not visible will also
      not be transferred to the client, saving even more memory and initial rendering time.
     </p>
     <p>
      The drawback of these features is a slight impact on performance when scrolling. If you
      experience unsatisfying performance while scrolling, try reducing the number of columns,
      or hide some columns (setting width to zero). When using the <em>VIRTUAL</em> flag,
      you will also experience a small rendering delay when scrolling to previously unseen data.
      You can reduce this effect by pre-caching data you assume will be displayed in the near future.
      A very basic implementation of such a feature could look like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="lang-java">
ScrollBar bar = viewer.getTable().getVerticalBar();
bar.addListener( SWT.Selection, new Listener(){
  public void handleEvent( Event event ) {
    Table table = viewer.getTable();
    int index = table.getTopIndex();
    int max = Math.min(  index + 100, table.getItemCount() );
    for( int i = index; i &lt; max; i++ ) {
      table.getItem( i ).getText();
    }
  }
} );</pre>


    <h3 id="rendering">Selection/Hover rendering order</h3>
    <p>
      Any item and every cell of an item may have a custom background to highlight a specific unit
      of data. In SWT (and RAP, by default), hovering or selecting such an item will completely
      overlay these backgrounds, essentially removing onscreen information. This behavior
      can be configured in RAP using the CSS Theming API. Note that any item that has a background
      set on all cells (or the item itself), will only be identifiable as selected by the text color,
      or not at all (if there is <i>also</i> a custom foreground set).
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition to the
     <em><a href="../reference/theming/Table.html#TableItem">TableItem</a></em> /
     <em><a href="../reference/theming/Tree.html#TreeItem">TreeItem</a></em>
     theming elements, there are also
     <em style="white-space:nowrap;"><a href="../reference/theming/Table.html#Table-RowOverlay">Table-RowOverlay</a></em> /
     <em style="white-space:nowrap;"><a href="../reference/theming/Tree.html#Tree-RowOverlay">Tree-RowOverlay</a></em>
     elements. In the default theme,
     these overlay elements are used to define the hover and selection behavior. If you wish
     for the item backgrounds to paint over the selection/hover effects, you will have to use
     these overlay element to create the effects. (You can also mix, so that hover or selection
     paints over the backgrounds, but not the other.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming you implement a
      <a href="theming.html#custom">complete custom theme</a>,
      this is easy. Simply use <i>only</i> the item element
      to define the effect and define the overlay element as below:
    </p>
    <pre class="lang-css">
Table-RowOverlay {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: inherit;
  background-image: none;
}</pre>
    <p>
      If you wish to only make a
      <a href="theming.html#contribution">theme contribution</a>,
      you also need to overwrite every possible
      combination for the overlay element that may be defined in the main/default theme:
    </p>
    <pre class="lang-css">Table-RowOverlay,
Table-RowOverlay:hover,
Table-RowOverlay:selected,
Table-RowOverlay:selected:unfocused,
Table-RowOverlay:linesvisible:even:hover,
Table-RowOverlay:linesvisible:even:selected,
Table-RowOverlay:linesvisible:even:selected:unfocused {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: inherit;
  background-image: none;
}</pre>
    <p>
      To create the new hover/selection effect you then have to define some or all of these combinations for the
      item element, for example:
    </p>
    <pre class="lang-css">TableItem:hover {
  color: #4a4a4a;
  background-color: #b5b5b5;
  background-image: gradient(
    linear, left top, left bottom,
    from( #ebebeb ),
    to( #d5d5d5 )
  );
}

TableItem:selected,
TableItem:linesvisible:even:selected {
  color: #ffffff;
  background-color: #5882b5;
  background-image: gradient(
    linear, left top, left bottom,
    from( #5882b5 ),
    to( #416693 )
  );
}</pre>
    <p>
      Alternatively, it's also possible to define semi-transparent background colors for the
      overlay element using the
      <a href="../reference/theming/Properties.html#format/rgba-color">rgba notation</a>.
      This would then create a hover/selection effect
      with the items background color(s) shining through.
    </p>

    <h3 id="nebula">Alternative: Nebula Grid</h3>
    <p>
      Available in the <a href="http://eclipse.org/rap/incubator/">RAP Incubator</a>
      is a RAP implementation of the
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/nebula/widgets/grid/grid.php">Nebula Grid</a>
      widget. Based on the same JavaScript
      code as tree and table, it adds features like column grouping,
      checkboxes on multiple columns, variable item height and column footer. (It does not
      support <i>all</i> features of the original Nebula Grid.)
