  <h1>File Upload</h1>
  <p>
    This article describes how to allow users to upload files from their local file system to the
    RAP server or another HTTP server.
    This can be done using a RAP <a href="#fileupload"><em>FileUpload</em></a> widget,
    the <a href="#dnd">drag and drop</a> API, or a <a href="#file-dialog"><em>FileDialog</em></a>.
  </p>

  <h2>FileUpload Widget</h2>
  <p id="fileupload">
    The
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/widgets/FileUpload.html">FileUpload</a></em>
    widget looks like a push button, but it will open the file picker dialog of the user's
    browser when clicked (it wraps an HTML <code>&lt;input type="file"/&gt;</code> element).
    When one or more files have been selected (indicated by a <em>Selection</em> event), these
    files can then be sent to any URL using the <em>submit</em> method.
  </p>
  <p>
    To receive a file on the server, RAP provides a service in the bundle
    <em>org.eclipse.rap.fileupload</em>.
    To use this service, create an instance of
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/fileupload/FileUploadHandler.html">FileUploadHandler</a></em>
    and obtain the upload URL from its method <code>getUploadUrl</code>.
    Here's a minimal example that uploads a file and stores it in a temporary directory:
  </p>
  <pre class="lang-java">final DiskFileUploadReceiver receiver = new DiskFileUploadReceiver();
final FileUploadHandler uploadHandler = new FileUploadHandler( receiver );
uploadHandler.addUploadListener( new FileUploadListener() {
  public void uploadProgress( FileUploadEvent event ) {}
  public void uploadFailed( FileUploadEvent event ) {}
  public void uploadFinished( FileUploadEvent event ) {
    System.out.println( "Stored file: " + receiver.getTargetFiles()[ 0 ].getAbsolutePath() );
  }
} );

final FileUpload fileUpload = new FileUpload( parent, SWT.NONE );
fileUpload.setText( "Select File" );
fileUpload.addSelectionListener( new SelectionAdapter() {
  @Override
  public void widgetSelected( SelectionEvent e ) {
    fileUpload.submit( uploadHandler.getUploadUrl() );
  }
} );
  </pre>
  <p>
    To upload multiple files at once, create the <em>FileUpload</em> with the
    <em>SWT.MULTI</em> flag. The files are stored in the temporary directory indefinitely,
    so you should take care to delete them once they are no longer needed.
  </p>

  <h2 id="dnd">File Drag and Drop</h2>
  <p>
    Modern browsers allow selecting a file from the file system using drag and drop. In RAP this
    feature has been integrated into the SWT drag and drop API. To make a control a target for file
    drop and drop, create an instance of
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/swt/dnd/DropTarget.html">DropTarget</a></em>
    with a
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/dnd/ClientFileTransfer.html">ClientFileTransfer</a></em>.
    The
    <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/dnd/DropTargetAdapter.html#drop-org.eclipse.swt.dnd.DropTargetEvent-">drop event</a>
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/events/TypedEvent.html#data">data</a></em>
    will the contain an array of
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/client/ClientFile.html">ClientFile</a></em>
    objects:
  </p>
  <pre class="lang-java">DropTarget dropTarget = new DropTarget( control, DND.DROP_MOVE );
dropTarget.setTransfer( new Transfer[] { ClientFileTransfer.getInstance() } );
dropTarget.addDropListener( new DropTargetAdapter() {
  @Override
  public void drop( DropTargetEvent event ) {
    handleFileDrop( ( ClientFile[] )event.data );
  }
} );
  </pre>
  <p>
    Note that unlike <q>normal</q> drag gestures, the drag feedback (the icon attached to
    the mouse cursor) is rendered by the operating system and may therefore look and behave
    different than usual in RAP. Also, the drop operation will always be move, even when
    the user holds a modifier key.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>ClientFile</em> objects represent the files selected on the client, but they are not
    uploaded yet. To do so, you have to use the
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/client/ClientFileUploader.html">ClientFileUploader</a></em>
    service and, <a href="#fileupload">like with
    the <em>FileUpload</em> widget above</a>, a <em>FileUploadHandler</em>:
  </p>
<pre>private void handleFileDrop( ClientFile[] files ) {
  final DiskFileUploadReceiver receiver = new DiskFileUploadReceiver();
  final FileUploadHandler uploadHandler = new FileUploadHandler( receiver );
  uploadHandler.addUploadListener( new FileUploadListener() {
    public void uploadProgress( FileUploadEvent event ) {}
    public void uploadFailed( FileUploadEvent event ) {}
    public void uploadFinished( FileUploadEvent event ) {
      System.out.println( "Stored file: " + receiver.getTargetFiles()[ 0 ].getAbsolutePath() );
    }
  } );
  RWT.getClient().getService( ClientFileUploader.class ).submit( uploadHandler.getUploadUrl(), files );
}
</pre>

  <h2 id="file-dialog">FileDialog</h2>
  <p>
    This is basically the all-in-one solution. The
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/swt/widget/FileDialog.html">FileDialog</a></em>
    provides an SWT compatible
    API that allows the user to select one or multiple files for the application to open.
    Once a file has been selected using the <em>FileUpload</em> (file picker) or file drag
    and drop, they are uploaded immediately. The dialog shows the upload progress
    (using <a href="server-push.html"><em>ServerPush</em></a>) and - unless canceled - can only be
    closed once all uploads are complete.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>FileDialog</em> can be used in RAP almost like in SWT, but there are some differences:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The <em>FileDialog</em> is <i>not</i> part of the RWT bundle. Because of its additional
      dependencies, it is contained in a bundle of its own, named <em>org.eclipse.rap.filedialog</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unlike the SWT <em>FileDialog</em>, the RAP version can only select files to <q>open</q>
      (i.e. upload). Creating the <em>FileDialog</em> with the <em>SWT.SAVE</em> flag has no effect.
      However, <em>SWT.MULTI</em> is supported.
    </li>
    <li>
      When no files are selected, the dialog shows a placeholder message. This message can be
      localized (see <a href="internationalization.html#messages">Localizing RAP Messages</a>).
      The corresponding properties are contained in the file <em>RWTMessages.properties</em>
      and they are prefixed with <em>RWT_FileDialog</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="rwt.html#dialog">Like all dialogs</a>, the <em>FileDialog</em> has to be opened
        differently in the <a href="application-setup.html#compat">JEE compatibility mode</a>:
      </p>
  <pre class="lang-java">final FileDialog fileDialog = new FileDialog( parent, SWT.APPLICATION_MODAL );

// SWT compatibility mode:
System.out.println( "Stored file: " + fileDialog.open() );

// JEE compatibility mode:
fileDialog.open( new DialogCallback() {
  public void dialogClosed( int returnCode ) {
    System.out.println( "Stored file: " + fileDialog.getFileName() );
  }
} );
  </pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
