  <h1>How to Create a Custom Widget for RAP?</h1>
  <p>
    Like in SWT, you can also create custom widgets to extend the RAP widget set to your needs.
    Examples range from simple compositions of existings controls to complex widgets such as
    custom tab folders, or animated graphs and charts.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are different types of custom widgets which will be described below.
    But no matter which type of custom widget you implement, you will end up with a RAP widget
    that has an SWT-like API and inherits some methods from an SWT super class.
    Therefore you should make yourself familiar with some important rules of SWT before you get
    started.<br/><br/>
    We highly recommend to read this article by the creators of SWT. <a href = "#ext1">[1]</a>.<br/>
    The RAP Wiki may cover more recent issues regarding custom widgets. <a href = "#ext2">[2]</a><br/>
  </p>
  <h2>Different types of custom widgets</h2>
  <p>
    These types differ a lot with regard to the features they support, the dependency on a certain
    platform, and also the effort and knowledge it takes to create them.
  </p>
  <h3 id="compound" >Compound widgets</h3>
  <p>
    These are the simplest ones.
    Compound widgets are compositions of existing SWT/RAP widgets.
    These widgets have to extend <code>Composite</code>.
    There is no fundamental difference between SWT and RAP for compound widgets.
    Everything that is said about compound widgets in <a href = "#ext1">[1]</a> also applies to RAP.
    f you want to make your compound widget visually distinct, 
    use a <a href = "../advanced/theming.html#variants">custom variants</a> to style the 
    <code>Composite</code> and its children.
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing a compound widget does not require any JavaScript knowledge.</li>
    <li>Cross-browser compatibility is ensured by RAP.</li>
    <li>The widgets are re-usable in desktop applications with SWT.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3 id="selfdrawing" >Self-drawing widgets</h3>
  <p>
    These are also simple in design.
    Sometimes you might want a widget that completely draws itself.
    This can be done by extending <code>Canvas</code>.
    The canvas widget supports drawing in a paint listener.
    For writing this kind of widgets, you can also follow <a href = "#ext1">[1]</a>.
    Please note that the drawing capabilities of RAP are limited compared to SWT.
    Especially in Internet Explorer 7 and 8, the performance degrades with the number of drawing
    operations.
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing a canvas widget does not require any JavaScript knowledge.</li>
    <li>Cross-browser compatibility is ensured by RAP.</li>
    <li>The widgets are re-usable in desktop applications with SWT.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If performance becomes an issue and your custom widgets has layers or areas that need to be
    redrawn considerably less often than others, you should consider combining this with the
    compound approach. Using multiple canvas widgets (stacked or in any layout), you can
    reduce the number of operations by just painting on the canvases that need to be updated.
    Note that modern browser draw very fast, so the impact of this strategy is much less noticeable
    than with older ones like Internet Explorer 7. (Though you also safe some traffic.)
  </p>
  <h3 id="browser" >Browser-based widgets</h3>
  <p>
    These can still be rather simple.
    The SWT <code>Browser</code> widget lets you place any HTML into your application.
    In RAP, this is no different. Any HTML document with JavaScript placed in a Browser widget
    will end up in an IFrame element. This makes it easy to wrap Web 2.0 applications. Those "mashups"
    may also be based on Flash or any other browser technologies, or include existing components
    from other JavaScript libraries. You can call JavaScript from Java by using
    <code>evaluate</code>, and vice versa with the <code>BrowserFunction</code> class.
    The drawback is that this kind of client-server communication is considerably less
    efficient that the RAP-internal Ajax architecture. (Requests may be more frequent and
    block the UI because they are synchronous.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Writing a Browser-based widget requires only minor-to-moderate JavaScript knowledge, unless
    you write the client component from scratch.<br/>
    Cross-browser compatibility is ensured by RAP only for the Browser widget itself, but
    not for the code that is running inside it. <br/>
    The widgets are re-usable in desktop applications with SWT when certain conditions apply
    (see below).<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember not to subclass <code>Browser</code> but extend <code>Composite</code> instead and
    wrap the Browser widget. This way, you do not expose the API of the Browser to the user of your
    widget, but instead provide an API that is specific for your widget. It's recommended
    to always use <code>evaluate</code> instead of <code>executeScript</code>. Before you can use
    <code>evaluate</code>, you must wait until the document is fully loaded, using either
    a <code>ProgressListener</code> or a <code>BrowserFunction</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each call
    to a <code>BrowserFunction</code> or to <code>evaluate</code> creates an HTTP request.
    To reduce the resulting traffic you
    can try combining sequential calls. A single call can transport as many information as you
    wish: <code>evaluate</code> has no limit on the number of executed JavaScript-functions.
    <code>BrowserFunctions</code> take any number of arguments and can return several values using
    an array of Object.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also important to decide how your resources (HTML JavaScript, CSS and image files) are
    provided to the browser widget. If you use only a moderate amount of HTML with inlined
    JavaScript and CSS (and no images), or most of your resources can be loaded from a different
    HTTP-server, it will suffice to use the <code>setText</code> method of the browser widget.
    The resulting custom widget will also run in an SWT application. However, when using
    <code>setText</code> the Browser can not cache the loaded document, so each new instance has
    to load and parse it again. <i> A good example of a
    “mashup” custom widget using this strategy is the <code>Browser</code>-based Google Maps widget<a href = "#ext3">[3]</a>.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    When a not all resources can be inlined in the HTML file (like images), and they are to be
    provided by the RAP application itself, there are multiple other options.
    However, the resulting custom widget will not work in an SWT application.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make an entire folder available via the <code>org.eclipse.equinox.http.registry.resources</code>
        extension point. This is the most simple way, but requires the
        <code>org.eclipse.equinox.http.registry</code> bundle. <i> To see an example of this, look
        at the JQuery-Carousel widget for RAP<a href = "#ext4">[4]</a>.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        Register each file using either the <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui.resources</code> extension
        point or your <code>org.eclipse.rwt.application.ApplicationConfiguration</code>. This only
        requires the RWT bundle itself, but necessitates creating a Java class implementing
        <code>org.eclipse.rwt.resources.IResource</code> for each resource-file. It may therefore
        not be suitable for a larger amount of files.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessing <code>ResourceManager</code> directly: This has some small overhead, but then requires
        only one line per registered file. All required code easily fits into your custom-widget
        class. No other bundles than RWT are required. <i>A good example for this is the CKEdtior widget<a href = "#ext4">[5]</a>.</i>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3 id="clientscripting" >ClientScripting-enhanced widgets</h3>
  <p>
    ClientScripting is a RAP Incubator component that allows adding client-side behavior to
    existing RAP widgets. When your custom-widget can graphically be represented by one or more
    existing SWT/RAP-widgets, but cannot be reasonably well implemented as a compound widget
    because of the latency of the
    HTTP-requests involved, ClientScripting is often the ideal solution. It can also help in
    <i>some</i> cases where certain SWT events are not implemented in RAP
    (<code>MouseEnter</code>/<code>MouseExit</code>), or are limited compared to SWT
    (<code>Verify</code>). ClientScripting
    is <b>not</b> to be confused with developing a native RAP custom widget. While it
    partially runs on the client, the difference is that ClientScripting provides an SWT-like API
    and does not require accessing RAP internals.
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing ClientScripting-enhanced widgets requires minor-to-moderate JavaScript knowledge,
    and no knowledge of any other browser technology.</li>
    <li>Cross-browser compatibility is ensured by RAP as long as EcmaScript-standards are followed and
    no DOM-elements or RAP-internals are accessed.</li>
    <li>The widgets are currently not innately re-usable in desktop applications with SWT.
    However, some code can be shared between both platforms, and the rest is easily ported.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    ClientScripting is as of June 2012 not yet feature-complete.
    However, all existing API is stable and bugs can be reported in the RAP Bugzilla.
    Detailed information
    can be found in the RAP Wiki<a href = "#ext6">[6]</a>.
    including some JavaScript hints and tips for Java Developer.
  </p>
  <h3 id="native" >Native Custom Widgets</h3>
  <p>
    Just like in SWT, writing real native custom widgets is hard. You need deep knowledge of both
    RAP and the platform you are developing for, i.e. the browser and any libraries you use.
    Also, in contrast to all other types of custom widgets, there is currently no guarantee
    that a native custom widget developed for one version of RAP will work in any future versions,
    as its partially based on internal API. This might be improved in RAP 2.0 (Kepler).
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing a native widget may require moderate-to-advanced knowledge of JavaScript, HTML/DOM, CSS
    and any other browser-technology you might want to use, in addition to a good knowledge of
    RAP internals.</li>
    <li>Cross-browser compatibility has to be ensured by the widget-developer.</li>
    <li>Native custom widgets are not re-usable in SWT desktop applications unless an additional
    SWT-specific version is being developed.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  </p>
    We currently recommend to use any of the alternatives above. A native custom widget should
    only be required if for some reason you need to work directly with HTML/DOM API, and the
    Browser widget is considered too inefficient for your use case Detailed information 
    for native RAP custom widget development can be found via the RAP Wiki<a href = "#ext7">[7]</a>.
