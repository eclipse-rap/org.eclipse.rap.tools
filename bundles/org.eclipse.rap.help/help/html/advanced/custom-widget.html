  <h1>How to Create a Custom Widget for RAP?</h1>

  <p>
    Just like in SWT, you can also create custom widgets to extend the RAP widget set to your needs.
    Examples range from simple Web2.0 mashups to complex widgets such as custom tab folders,
    or widgets that display graphs and charts.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are different types of custom widgets which will be described below.
    But no matter which type of custom widget you implement, you will end up with an SWT widget
    that has an SWT-like API and inherits some methods from an SWT super class.
    Therefore you should make yourself familiar with some important rules of SWT before you get
    started.
    We highly recommend to read this article by the creators of SWT:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      [1] <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Writing%20Your%20Own%20Widget/Writing%20Your%20Own%20Widget.htm">Writing Your Own Widget</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Different types of custom widgets</h2>
  <p>
    These types differ a lot with regard to the features they support, the dependency on a certain
    platform, and also the effort it takes to create them.
  </p>

  <h3>Compound widgets</h3>
  <p>
    These are the simplest ones.
    Compound widgets are compositions of existing SWT widgets.
    These widgets have to extend <code>Composite</code>.
    There is no difference between SWT and RAP for compound widgets.
    Everything that is said about compound widgets in [1] also applies to RAP.
  </p>
  <p>
    Writing a compound widget does not require any JavaScript knowledge.
    The widgets are re-usable in desktop applications with SWT.
  </p>

  <h3>Self-drawing widgets</h3>
  <p>
    These are also simple.
    Sometimes you might want to need a widget that draws itself.
    This can be done by extending <code>Canvas</code>.
    The canvas widget supports drawing in a paint listener.
    For writing this kind of widgets, you can also follow [1].
    Please note that the drawing capabilities of RAP are limited compared to SWT.
    Especially in Internet Explorer browsers, the performance degrades with the number of drawing
    operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Writing a canvas widget does not require any JavaScript knowledge.
    The widgets are re-usable in desktop applications with SWT.
  </p>

  <h3>Browser-based widgets</h3>
  <p>
    These are still rather simple.
    The SWT <code>Browser</code> widget lets you place any HTML into your application.
    In RAP, this is no different.
    Any JavaScript code placed in a Browser widget will end up in an IFrame element.
    This makes it easy to wrap Web2.0 mashups or include existing components from other JavaScript
    libraries.
    Using the SWT <code>BrowserFunction</code> API, you can even send events from the JavaScript
    code that runs in the browser to the Java code of your widget.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember not to subclass <code>Browser</code> but extend <code>Composite</code> instead and
    wrap the Browser widget.
    This way, you do not expose the API of the Browser to user of your widget, but instead provide
    an API that is specific for your widget.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good example of a “mashup” custom widget for Google Maps can be found in [2].
    Another example [3] shows how to include a JQuery UI widget into a browser-based custom widget.

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Real native widgets</h3>
  <p>
    Just like in SWT, writing real native custom widgets is hard.
    You need deep knowledge of both RAP and the platform you are developing for, i.e. the browser
    and any libraries you use.
    You have to know the JavaScript library of RAP, the communication between client and server, the
    request lifecycle, and life cycle adapters.
    Luckily, you get around writing native custom widgets most of the time by using one of the above
    solutions.
    Future versions of RAP will simplify the writing of native custom widgets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Native custom widgets are not re-usable on the desktop unless a specific desktop version is
    being developed.
  </p>

  <h2>Creating native custom widgets</h2>

  <p>
    A RAP widget consists of a client part and a server part.
    Both parts have to be synchronized.
    There are different tasks to create a new custom widget which will be covered here:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>create the server-side part of the widget</li>
    <li>create the client-side part of the widget</li>
    <li>create an adapter to connect the server part to the RAP lifecycle</li>
    <li>register the JavaScript files</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As an exemplary widget we will implement a native Google maps widget.
    You can find the example code for this widget in the RAP CVS:<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>dev.eclipse.org/cvsroot/rt/org.eclipse.rap/sandbox/org.eclipse.rap.demo.gmaps</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Note</em>: this example is here for historical reasons, today you could do the same using
    the Browser widget as shown in [2].
  </p>

  <h3>Creating the widget</h3>

  <p>
    To have a clear line between your application and your widgets we'll create a new plug-in
    project called <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo.gmaps</code>. We don't need any additional
    aspects like an RCP application or an activator.
  </p>

  <img src="../../images/custom-widget/newproject.png" alt="New Plugin Project wizard"/>

  <p>
    The first step is to create a java class - the widget itself - to talk to the developer like
    every other widget. In our case we will call it <code>GMap.java</code> in place it into the
    <code>org.eclipse.rap.gmaps</code> package. As super class we use <code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite</code>
    to have to have a proper base class which interacts with the rest of SWT. To store the address which
    will be shown on the map, we create a new field in the <code>GMap</code> class called <code>address</code>
    and will generate the corresponding setter and getter. The setter - <code>setAdress( String )</code> - should
    check for <code>null</code> values and replacing <code>null</code> with an empty string instead. It
    should look like this in the end:
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  public void setAddress( String address ) {
    if( address == null ) {
      this.address = "";
    } else {
      this.address = address;
    }
  }
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    To have an example for the other way around - from client to server - we introduce another
    field called <code>centerLocation</code> to get the current location of the map when the
    user moves it around. This is done by adding a new field to the class together with its
    getter and setter:
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  private String centerLocation;

  public void setCenterLocation( String location ) {
    this.centerLocation = location;
  }

  public String getCenterLocation() {
    return this.centerLocation;
  }
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Additionally we override the <code>setLayout(Layout)</code> method of <code>Composite</code>
    with an empty method as our custom widget does not contain any other widgets.
    That's all for now - this is all needed by the developers who want to use our the custom widget.
    Now it gets interesting as we have to work out the JavaScript side of our widget.
  </p>

  <h3>Client-side implementation</h3>

  <p>
    On the client side our widget is just a JavaScript class defined with the
    <a href="http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/0.7/class_declaration">qooxdoo syntax</a>.
    As super class we need to use at least
    <a href="http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/#qx.ui.core.Widget">qx.ui.core.Widget</a>.
    To have an easier life we will directly use one of the
    <a href="http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/0.7/layout_manager">qooxdoo layout managers</a>
    as base of our widget. The code for the new qooxdoo class together with qooxdoo's
    <code>CanvasLayout</code> as super class will look like this:
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  qx.Class.define( "org.eclipse.rap.gmaps.GMap", {
  extend: qx.ui.layout.CanvasLayout,
      // ...
  } );
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    The first thing we need to create is the constructor for that class in order to initialize our widget properly.
    As parameter we have an <code>id</code> which will be passed to the widget by us in a later step.
    The first line is a base call which is the same as super in a java environment.
    For now we populate the <code>id</code> to the browsers DOM by adding a new HTML attribute with <code>setHtmlAttribute</code>.
    You see some Google Maps-specific calls here which are just there to initialize the Google Maps
    subsystem. See the
    <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/documentation">Google Maps API Documentation</a>
    for more information.
    The two <a href="http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/0.7/using_events">event listeners</a> for the
    qooxdoo widget will take care for the size calculations. This means that whenever the server
    sets a new size for the widget we care about our widget to lay out everything inside
    (in this case the map) correctly.
    The called method <code>_doResize</code> will be implemented later.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  qx.Class.define( "org.eclipse.rap.gmaps.GMap", {
  extend: qx.ui.layout.CanvasLayout,
  <b>
    construct: function( id ) {
      this.base( arguments );
      this.setHtmlAttribute( "id", id );
      this._id = id;
      this._map = null;
      if( GBrowserIsCompatible() ) {
        this._geocoder = new GClientGeocoder();
        this.addEventListener( "changeHeight", this._doResize, this );
        this.addEventListener( "changeWidth", this._doResize, this );
      }
    }
  </b>
  } );
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    To save the address of the widget somewhere we use the
    <a href="http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/0.7/properties">property system</a> of qooxdoo.
    Adding a new property will look like this:
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  qx.Class.define( "org.eclipse.rap.gmaps.GMap", {
  extend: qx.ui.layout.CanvasLayout,
      construct: function( id ) {
        // ...
      }<b>,  // &lt;-- comma added, see JavaScript syntax reference

      properties : {
        address : {
          init : "",
          apply : "load"
        }
      }
      </b>
    }
  } );
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Qooxdoo will automatically generate the corresponding setter and getter at runtime for us.
    So if we want to read the current address of our client-side widget we just need to call
    <code>getAdress</code> on a our client-side GMap object. As you see in the <code>apply</code> attribute
    of your address property the method <code>load</code> will be called when the value of the
    property changes. So let's implement it:
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  qx.Class.define( "org.eclipse.rap.gmaps.GMap", {
  extend: qx.ui.layout.CanvasLayout,
      construct: function( id ) {
        // ...
      },

      properties : {
        // ...
      }<b>,  // &lt;-- comma added, see JavaScript syntax reference

      members : {
        _doActivate : function() {
            var shell = null;
            var parent = this.getParent();
            while( shell == null &amp;&amp; parent != null ) {
                if( parent.classname == "org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell" ) {
                    shell = parent;
                }
                parent = parent.getParent();
            }
            if( shell != null ) {
                shell.setActiveChild( this );
            }
        },

        load : function() {
            var current = this.getAddress();
            if( GBrowserIsCompatible() &amp;&amp; current != null &amp;&amp; current != &quot;&quot; ) {
                qx.ui.core.Widget.flushGlobalQueues();
                if( this._map == null ) {
                    this._map = new GMap2( document.getElementById( this._id ) );
                    this._map.addControl( new GSmallMapControl() );
                    this._map.addControl( new GMapTypeControl() );
                    GEvent.bind( this._map, "click", this, this._doActivate );
                    GEvent.bind( this._map, "moveend", this, this._onMapMove );

                }
                var map = this._map;
                map.clearOverlays();
                this._geocoder.getLatLng(
                current,
                function( point ) {
                    if( !point ) {
                        alert( "'" + current + "' not found" );
                        } else {
                        map.setCenter( point, 13 );
                        var marker = new GMarker( point );
                        map.addOverlay( marker );
                        marker.openInfoWindowHtml( current );
                    }
                }
                );
            }
        },

        _onMapMove : function() {
            if( !org_eclipse_rap_rwt_EventUtil_suspend ) {
                var wm = org.eclipse.swt.WidgetManager.getInstance();
                var gmapId = wm.findIdByWidget( this );
                var center = this._map.getCenter().toString();
                var req = org.eclipse.swt.Request.getInstance();
                req.addParameter( gmapId + ".centerLocation", center );
            }
        },

        _doResize : function() {
            qx.ui.core.Widget.flushGlobalQueues();
            if( this._map != null ) {
                this._map.checkResize();
            }
        }
      }
      </b>
  } );
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    There is a little hack involved which is easily explained. We need to listen to click
    events in the map and connect them with our <code>_doActivate</code> method to activate
    the current shell. This is needed because Google Maps API is implemented with an IFrame
    and current browser generations send events only to their document. The IFrame is handled
    as a separate document and thus we cannot catch the events to let the shell be activated with
    the standard mechanism. This is obsolete for custom widgets without IFrames.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other event listener for the <code>moveend</code> event will trigger a function to send
    the current location of the map to the server. Therefore we need to get the Id - which is
    allocated by RAP - of the current widget  and obtained via the WidgetManager on the client side.
    Then we use the current <code>Request</code> object to add a new parameter which will be
    processed later at the server side. If you want to immediately send the parameter to the server
    use <code>req.send()</code>. But as we don't need this for now we just add the parameter
    to the request object and it will be transfered automatically to the server with the next request.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok, we're almost done with our client-side implementation. But the key part of the whole widget
    is still missing: the piece between the server and the client.
  </p>
  <p style="border:1px dotted grey;">
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Although the RAP client is derived from qooxdoo 0.7, it does not contain the same classes
    as the original qooxdoo 0.7 library.
    It was heavily stripped down and adapted.
    Therefore you should not rely on the qooxdoo documentation and should avoid using other classes
    from qooxdoo than Terminator, CanvasLayout, the event system and the RWT classes required for
    communicating with the server.
    Future versions of RAP will provide a stable API for custom widget development.
  </p>

  <h3>Filling the gap between client and server</h3>
  <p>
    In our current situation we have already done two important tasks: the server-
    and the client-side widget. Now we need to connect each other in order to
    control the widget on the client by calling it on the server (where our
    application lives).
    In RAP - more precisely in RWT - we have a concept called the <em>life cycle</em>. With each request
    from the client the life cycle on the server side will be executed. It is responsible to process
    all changes and events from the client and in the end it will send back a response to the client
    what to do (mostly hide/show widgets, update data, etc).
    The life cycle itself is split up in several phases which are executed in a specific order.
  </p>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Phase</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ReadData</td>
        <td>This is responsible to read the values sent from the client like occurred events.
        At the end of this phase, all widget attributes are in sync again with the values on the client.
        The attributes are preserved for later use.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ProcessAction</td>
        <td>ProcessAction is responsible for dispatching the events to the widgets. Attributes may
        change in this phase as a response for the events.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Render</td>
        <td>At the end of the lifecycle every change will be rendered to the client.<br />
        Be aware that only values which are different than there preserved ones are send to
        the client (means: only the delta).</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    To participate in the life cycle - what is what we want to do with our custom widget -
    we need to provide a Life Cycle Adapter (LCA). There are two ways to connect the LCA
    with our widget. On the one hand side we can return it directly when someone asks our widget
    with <code>getAdapter</code> to provide an LCA. This can be done by implementing the
    <code>getAdapter</code> method in our own widget like this:
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  ...
  public Object getAdapter( Class adapter ) {
    Object result;
    if( adapter == ILifeCycleAdapter.class ) {
      result = new MyCustomWidgetLCA(); // extends AbstractWidgetLCA
    } else {
      result = super.getAdapter( adapter );
    }
    return result;
  }
  ...
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    The preferred way is to let RAP do this itself by creating the LCA class in a
    package called &lt;widgetpackage&gt;.internal.&lt;widgetname&gt;kit.&lt;widgetname&gt;LCA.
    The order of the internal does not play the big role. The important thing is
    to have internal in the package name, the package with the LCA is called
    &lt;widgetname&gt;kit and the LCA itself is called &lt;widgetname&gt;LCA.<br/>
    Here a little example:<br/>
    If our widget is named <code>org.eclipse.rap.gmaps.GMap</code>,
    <br/>
    then our LCA should be named <code>org.eclipse.rap.internal.gmaps.gmapkit.GMapLCA</code>.
    <br/>
    The LCA class itself must have <code>org.eclipse.rwt.lifecycle.AbstractWidgetLCA</code>
    as the super class and implement its abstract methods.
    We'll just show you a little overview of the methods and their role and then
    go further to implement a working LCA for our GMaps widget.
  </p>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Method name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>renderInitialization(Widget)</code></td>
      <td>This method is called to initialize your widget. Normally you will
      tell RAP which client-side class to use and how it is initialized
      (think of style bits)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>preserveValues(Widget)</code></td>
      <td>Here we have to preserve our values so we can see at the end of
      the lifecycle if something has changes during the process action
      phase.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>renderChanges(Widget)</code></td>
      <td>That's the most interesting part. We need to sync the attributes of the
      widget on the server with the the client-side implementation by sending
      the changes to the client.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>renderDispose(Widget)</code></td>
      <td>You can tidy up several things here before the widget gets disposed
      of on the client.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    After having a brief overview of the principles of the Life Cycle Adapter let's start
    by implementing the LCA for our GMap widget.
    After creating the LCA class - which extends AbstractWidgetLCA - we will fill the interesting
    methods with some logic. First comes the initialization.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  public void renderInitialization( Widget widget ) throws IOException {
    JSWriter writer = JSWriter.getWriterFor( widget );
    String id = WidgetUtil.getId( widget );
    writer.newWidget( "org.eclipse.rap.gmaps.GMap", new Object[] { id } );
    writer.set( "overflow", "hidden" );
    ControlLCAUtil.writeStyleFlags( ( GMap )widget );
  }
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    The <code>JSWriter</code> provides methods to generate JavaScript code that
    updates the client-side state of our widget.
    Each widget has its own <code>JSWriter</code> instance so that RAP can decide
    to which widget the call belongs.
    As you can see in the snippet, <code>JSWriter#newWidget</code> is called to create a new widget
    on the client side. The second parameters is an array of <code>Object</code>s which are
    passed to the constructor of the qooxdoo class (see above).
    With <code>JSWriter#set</code> you can easily set different attributes of your qooxdoo object.
    Note that there are overloaded methods of <code>set</code> that take care
    that JavaScript code is only generated if <em>necessary</em>. That means if a
    certain property was left unchanged during the request processing, no JavaScript
    code is generated.
    </p>
    <p>
    The next step is to preserve the relevant properties of our widget. After that
    the <code>set</code>-methods from <code>JSWriter</code> can determine whether
    it is necessary to actually generate JavaScript code.
    As there is only the <code>address</code> property which could change, this
    is straight forward.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  private static final String PROP_ADDRESS = "address";

  public void preserveValues( Widget widget ) {
    // Preserve properties that are inherited from Control
    ControlLCAUtil.preserveValues( ( Control )widget );

    // Preserve the 'address' property
    IWidgetAdapter adapter = WidgetUtil.getAdapter( widget );
    adapter.preserve( PROP_ADDRESS, ( ( GMap )widget ).getAddress() );

    // Only needed for custom variants (theming)
    WidgetLCAUtil.preserveCustomVariant( widget );
  }
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    First we use <code>ControlLCAUtil#preserveValues</code> to preserve all
    properties that are inherited by <code>Control</code> (tooltip, tabindex,
    size, etc.).
    So we only need to care about the things implemented in our widget.
    We just request a so-called <code>IWidgetAdapter</code> which is responsible for different
    aspects in the lifecycle of a widget. In this case we only use it to preserve
    the <code>address</code> value
    with a predefined key (<code>PROP_ADRESS</code>) to associate it later.<br />
    The last line calling <code>preserveCustomVariant</code> is only added for the
    sake of completeness.
    Variants are a way to have different looks of the same widget and is part of the
    theme engine. Please see the <a href="theming-custom.html">Prepare Custom
    Widgets for Theming</a> article for further information.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following step is one of most interesting parts of your lifecycle adapter - the
    <code>renderChanges</code> method. As said before it is responsible to write every
    change to the outgoing stream which is executed on the client. Let's take a look at the
    implementation:
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  private static final String JS_PROP_ADDRESS = "address";

  public void renderChanges( Widget widget ) throws IOException {
    GMap gmap = ( GMap )widget;
    ControlLCAUtil.writeChanges( gmap );
    JSWriter writer = JSWriter.getWriterFor( widget );
    writer.set( PROP_ADDRESS, JS_PROP_ADDRESS, gmap.getAddress() );

    // only needed for custom variants (theming)
    WidgetLCAUtil.writeCustomVariant( widget );
  }
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Again we use the <code>ControlLCAUtil</code> to write the changes which are implemented on
    <code>Control</code> and thus we should not care what's behind it (for those who really want to know it -
    it's the same as preserving the values like tooltip, tabindex, size, etc).
    Like in the widget initialization we have to render something and therefore we
    need to obtain the corresponding <code>JSWriter</code> instance for our widget. We need to use
    <code>JSWriter#set</code> to set a specific attribute to the widget instance on the client-side.
    There are many different <code>set</code> implementations available for every need. The one used
    here is simple: We pass the key for the preserved value to the method so RAP can check if there has
    something changed since the last time it was preserved, we pass the name of the client-side attribute
    which gets transformed into "set*" and last but not least the value for this setter.
    As we can see, the name of the JavaScript attribute (<code>JS_PROP_ADRESS</code>) will call the method
    <code>setAdress</code> on the corresponding widget instance on the client. If you wonder where this
    method is, take a look at the qooxdoo property system. The address property of our widget will be transformed
    by qooxdoo into a set* and get* methods at runtime.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now we need to process the actions transfered to the server (at least if there are any).
    We see in the <code>GMap.js</code> that if the user moves the map a new parameter called
    <code>centerLocation</code> will be attached to the current request and transfered to the
    server. To read and process it the <code>readData</code> method of the LCA is used.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  private static final String PARAM_CENTER = "centerLocation";

  public void readData( Widget widget ) {
    GMap map = ( GMap )widget;
    String location = WidgetLCAUtil.readPropertyValue( map, PARAM_CENTER );
    map.setCenterLocation( location );
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    As you can see, it's really easy. You just need to ask the <code>WidgetLCAUtil#readPropertyValue</code>
    for the parameter and pass it to the server-side widget implementation. If you wonder why the
    center location does not get written in the <code>renderChanges</code> method we implemented above:
    This will be your task at the end of the tutorial.
    Normally you won't have public methods for attributes which are not changeable programmatically.
    For this you would use an adapter or another mechanism to implement the setter behind the scenes.
    At the end of the tutorial it is your task hide the public <code>setCenterLocation</code>
    method of the <code>GMap</code> widget or - even better - to implement the rendering of
    the center location yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last step is to implement the way our widget is disposed on the client. Normally there is no
    need to care for anything else and this is also the case with our GMap widget. If you really have
    to do any other stuff like calling specific methods before the widget is disposed you should do it
    here.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  public void renderDispose( Widget widget ) throws IOException {
    JSWriter writer = JSWriter.getWriterFor( widget );
    writer.dispose();
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    There are now two additional methods called <code>createResetHandlerCalls</code> and
    <code>getTypePoolId</code>. These were introduced by a mechanism that helps to soften the massive
    memory consumption on the client. Many of the client-side widgets are not thrown away
    anymore, but kept in an object pool for later reuse. Especially with long-running
    applications in the Internet Explorer browser, this can make a huge difference. Please
    note that this topic is work in progress and, despite extensive
    testing, might lead to errors under different circumstances. We recommend not to use this
    in your custom widgets.
  </p>

  <h3>Registering the JavaScript files</h3>
  <p>
    Loading the client application (with our widget) in a browser will still lead to problems
    as nobody knows about the JavaScript resources and where to find them. We can fix this
    by using the <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui.resources</code> extension point. We add two new extensions,
    one for our custom widget JavaScript file and one for the external JavaScript library of Google
    Maps.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  &lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;extension
      id="org.eclipse.rap.gmaps.gmap"
      point="org.eclipse.rap.ui.resources"&gt;
        &lt;resource class="org.eclipse.rap.gmaps.GMapResource"/&gt;
        &lt;resource class="org.eclipse.rap.gmaps.GMapAPIResource"/&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;/plugin&gt;
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Both classes refer to an implementation of <code>org.eclipse.rwt.resources.IResource</code>.
    The first one - our custom widget itself - is really easy to implement. We just need to tell
    RAP that it is a JavaScript file, where it can find the file and which charset to use. So the
    <code>IResource></code> implementation for the widget JavaScript could look like this:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  public class GMapResource implements IResource {

    public String getCharset() {
      return "UTF-8";
    }

    public ClassLoader getLoader() {
      return this.getClass().getClassLoader();
    }

    public RegisterOptions getOptions() {
      return RegisterOptions.VERSION_AND_COMPRESS;
    }

    public String getLocation() {
      return "org/eclipse/rap/gmaps/GMap.js";
    }

    public boolean isJSLibrary() {
      return true;
    }

    public boolean isExternal() {
      return false;
    }
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    For the charset we need to return a string to describe the charset. If you're not sure
    you can use of the constants defined in <code>org.eclipse.rwt.internal.util.HTML</code> but be
    aware that this is internal. The <code>getOptions</code> method specifies if the file should
    be delivered with any special treatment. Possible ways are <code>NONE</code>, <code>VERSION</code>,
    <code>COMPRESS</code> and <code>VERSION_AND_COMPRESS</code>. <code>VERSION</code> means that
    RAP will append a hash value of the file itself to tell the browser if he should use an already
    cached version or reload the file from the server. With the <code>COMPRESS</code> option RAP will
    remove all unnecessary stuff like blank lines or comments from the JavaScript file in order
    to save bandwidth and parse time.
    Remote files like our next task - the Google Maps library - are handled a little bit different.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  public class GMapAPIResource implements IResource {

    private static final String KEY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY = "org.eclipse.rap.gmaps.key";

    // key for localhost rap development on port 9090
    private static final String KEY_LOCALHOST
      = "ABQIAAAAjE6itH-9WA-8yJZ7sZwmpRQz5JJ2zPi3YI9JDWBFF"
      + "6NSsxhe4BSfeni5VUSx3dQc8mIEknSiG9EwaQ";

    private String location;

    public String getCharset() {
      return "UTF-8";
    }

    public ClassLoader getLoader() {
      return this.getClass().getClassLoader();
    }

    public RegisterOptions getOptions() {
      return RegisterOptions.VERSION;
    }

    public String getLocation() {
      if( location == null ) {
        String key = System.getProperty( KEY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY );
        if( key == null ) {
          key = KEY_LOCALHOST;
        }
        location = "http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&amp;v=2&amp;key=" + key;
      }
      return location;
    }

    public boolean isJSLibrary() {
      return true;
    }

    public boolean isExternal() {
      return true;
    }
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    To tell RAP to load external resources we just need to return <code>true</code> in
    <code>isExternal</code>. The location should be a valid URL where the resource resides.
    In this case it's loaded from the Google Maps server with a special API key. This is specific
    for the Google Maps widget and is not needed by other widgets. If you're planning to use
    or extend this sample widget we encourage you to get your <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html">
    own API key</a> for Google as this key
    will only work on http://localhost:9090/rap. With every other combination of host, port or
    servletName you need to obtain a new key. Additionally we implemented a system property
    to define the key without recompiling the widget.
    <br />
    We've just finished our custom widget and our project structure should look like this if we have done everything right.
  </p>
  <img src="../../images/custom-widget/project.png" alt="Project structure"/>

  <h3>Test the widget</h3>
  <p>
    In order to test the widget we will create a new plug-in project with the following entrypoint:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  public class GMapDemo implements IEntryPoint {

    public int createUI() {
      Display display = new Display();
      Shell shell = new Shell( display, SWT.SHELL_TRIM );
      shell.setLayout( new FillLayout() );
      shell.setText( "GMaps Demo" );

      GMap map = new GMap( shell, SWT.NONE );
      map.setAddress( "Stephanienstraße 20, Karlsruhe" );

      shell.setSize( 300, 300 );
      shell.open();
      while( !shell.isDisposed() ) {
        if( !display.readAndDispatch() ) {
          display.sleep();
        }
      }
      return 0;
    }
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Don't forget to add <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui</code> and the GMap widget project as dependencies.
    Then we need to register our entry point via the <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui.entrypoint</code>. If
    everything went well our demo should look like this after starting the server:
  </p>
  <img src="../../images/custom-widget/demo.png" alt="Widget demo"/>
  <p>
    But there was more: the center location we sent to the server. To read it out, we extend the sample
    with a new button:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  public class GMapDemo implements IEntryPoint {

    public int createUI() {
      Display display = new Display();
      final Shell shell = new Shell( display, SWT.SHELL_TRIM );
      shell.setLayout( new FillLayout() );
      shell.setText( "GMaps Demo" );

      GMap map = new GMap( shell, SWT.NONE );
      map.setAddress( "Stephanienstraße 20, Karlsruhe" );

      Button button = new Button( shell, SWT.PUSH );
      button.setText( "Tell me where I am!" );
      button.addSelectionListener( new SelectionAdapter() {
        public void widgetSelected( SelectionEvent e ) {
          String msg = "You are here: " + map.getCenterLocation()
          MessageDialog.openInformation( shell, "GMap Demo", msg );
        }
      } );

      shell.setSize( 300, 300 );
      shell.open();
      while( !shell.isDisposed() ) {
        if( !display.readAndDispatch() ) {
          display.sleep();
        }
      }
      return 0;
    }
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    After a click on the button the current location will be sent to the server (together
    with the selection event of the button), applied to the widget with the help of our LCA
    and shown by the MessageDialog. Great!
  </p>

  <h3>And now?</h3>
  <p>
    You completed your first custom widget - congratulations!<br />
    Before implementing a heavy custom control we like to give you some tasks to play around
    with the GMap widget.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement the rendering for the center location to programmatically set it</li>
    <li>Add support for <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/overlays.html">markers</a></li>
    <li>Implement other nice things by connecting Google Maps with RAP</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We are delight in seeing what you can do with this little widget. If you
    have problems, take a look at all the LCAs already provided by RAP. It's
    not black magic.
  </p>

  <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>Client debugging</h4>
  <p>
    Browser-based JavaScript debugging tools such as Firebug can be very helpful.
    To enable client debugging, remember to start your application in <em>Debug</em> mode.
    This setting preserves the original formatting of the JavaScript code delivered to the client,
    whereas it is compressed and obfuscated in the <em>Standard</em> mode.
    You can enable the Debug mode directly in the RAP Launcher
    (see option <em class="UILabel">Client-side library variant</em>) or by setting the system property
    <code>-Dorg.eclipse.rwt.clientLibraryVariant=DEBUG</code> as VM parameter.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use the <code>console</code> API to add temporary logging output to your JavaScript
    code.
