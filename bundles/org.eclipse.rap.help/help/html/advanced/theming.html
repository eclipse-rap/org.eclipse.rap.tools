<h1>RWT Theming</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  This article describes the theming of RWT, the RAP Widget Toolkit.
  This theming defines the <em>default</em> look and feel of the RWT widgets.
  It is not related to Eclipse workbench concepts like the workbench theming
  or custom stack presentations.
  Instead, it resembles the theming capabilities commonly provided by desktop
  systems that allow users to set their custom colors for window title bars,
  custom fonts, and the like.
</p>

<p>
  The theming controls various aspects of the widget's appearance such as
  colors, fonts, and borders.
  Even advanced effects as gradients and animations are supported.
  As an example, the following screenshots show the same dialog with the
  default theme and with a custom theme.
  As you can see, a custom theme does not only alter some colors, it also
  affects the size of widgets by changing dimension properties like paddings,
  borders, and font sizes.

</p>

<p>
  RWT themes are being defined by CSS files that are registered with the
  extension point <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui.themes</code>.
  Existing themes can be extended by theme contributions using the same
  extension point.
  The CSS files are not directly passed to the client's browser, but parsed
  and evaluated by RAP on the server side.
  The reason for this is that RAP executes all layout calculations on the server
  and thus, the server needs to know the actual sizes of borders, margins and
  paddings for every widget.
  After evaluating the CSS theme file, the server passes a pre-processed
  version of the style definitions to the client.
</p>

<h2>How to Register a Custom RWT Theme</h2>

<h3>1. Create a Theme File (CSS)</h3>

<p>
  Create a *.css file as explained above and place it somewhere in your project.
  Since your theme probably needs image resources as well, an extra theme folder
  is recommended.
  Remember to include this folder in the project's <code>build.properties</code>
  file to make them available in a deployment.
</p>

<h3>2. Register the Custom Theme</h3>

<p>
  In order to make your theme available for RAP, you have to register it with
  the extension point <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui.themes</code>.
  In the <code>plugin.xml</code> of your application project, add an extension
  like this:
</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;extension
      point=&quot;org.eclipse.rap.ui.themes&quot;&gt;
    &lt;theme
        id=&quot;my.application.aquablue&quot;
        name=&quot;Aqua Blue Test Theme&quot;
        file=&quot;theme/aquablue.css&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
  Now your theme is registered, but your application still doesn't use it.
</p>

<h3>3. Activate the Custom Theme</h3>
<p>
  To make your application use the custom theme you have to register a branding.
  In short, a branding binds several settings (including the theme to use) to a
  servlet name.
  For more details, refer to the article on
  <a href="./branding.html">RAP Branding</a>.
  For example, the following extension makes the application available at
  the URL <code>http://hostname:port/aqua</code>
</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;extension
      point=&quot;org.eclipse.rap.ui.branding&quot;&gt;
    &lt;branding
        id=&quot;my.application.aquabranding&quot;
        servletName=&quot;aqua&quot;
        defaultEntrypointId=&quot;my.application.entrypoint1&quot;
        themeId=&quot;my.application.aquablue&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/branding&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>How to Extend an Existing RWT Theme</h2>

<h3>1. Create a Theme File (CSS)</h3>

<p>
  Create a *.css file that extends an existing theme.
  The theme file can be placed anywhere in your project.
  The extension theme file can also refer to images kept in the project.
  Don't forget to include everything in the project's
  <code>build.properties</code> file.
</p>

<h3>2. Register the Theme Contribution</h3>

<p>
  Register the contribution with the extension point
  <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui.themes</code>, using a <code>themeContribution</code>
  element.
  In the <code>plugin.xml</code> of your application project, the extension
  will look like this:
</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;extension
      point=&quot;org.eclipse.rap.ui.themes&quot;&gt;
    &lt;themeContribution
        themeId=&quot;my.application.aquablue&quot;
        file=&quot;aqua-extensions.css&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
  Now your theme contribution is registered and will automatically added to the
  existing theme.
</p>

<p>
  Note that many contributions can be added to a theme and the order in which
  those contributions are appended is undefined.
  Therefore, you should only add rules to the extension CSS file that will not
  be overridden by other contributions.
  As an example, rules for custom variants (see below) that are defined in the
  same plug-in will be safe as long as other theme contributions do not
  reference the same variants.
</p>

<h2>CSS Primer</h2>

<p>
  The theme files for RAP are written in CSS using widget types as element
  names.
  The syntax must be valid
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS 2.1</a>,
  although RAP does not support the complete CSS syntax.
  Some advanced concepts like &quot;@&quot;-rules and certain selector types are
  not supported.
  This section explains the basic rules for writing CSS theme files.
  The CSS file contained in the demo project
  (<code>org.eclipse.rap.demo</code>) can serve as a more complex example.
</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>
  A CSS file is simply a sequence of style rules.
  A style rule is a selector or a comma separated selector list, followed by
  a block of declarations enclosed in braces.
  Declarations start with a property name, followed by a colon, followed by a
  value and end with a semicolon.
  The following is an example of a simple theme file, consisting of two style
  rules:
</p>

<pre><code>  Button[PUSH], Button[TOGGLE] {
    border: 2px solid blue;
    color: rgb( 17, 23, 103 );
    background-color: #f9f9f9;
  }

  Button[PUSH]:hover, Button[TOGGLE]:hover {
    background-color: white;
  }
</code></pre>

<h3>Selectors</h3>

<p>
  A selector defines to which widgets or components of a widget a rule applies.
  Selectors can refer to SWT style flags and also to certain widget states.
  The element names to be used are either simple widget type names,
  such as <code>Button</code> and <code>Table</code>, or names of sub-components
  of a widget like <code>ProgressBar-Indicator</code>.
  A complete list of themeable widgets and their element names can be found in
  the <a href="../reference/theming/index.html">theming reference</a>.
</p>

<h4>Styles and States</h4>

<p>
  Certain SWT style flags can be referred to in CSS selectors to allow to define
  a styling depending on the widget type.
  For style flags, the attribute syntax from CSS must be used:
</p>

<pre><code>  Button[BORDER] {
    ...
  }
</code></pre>

<p>
  In addition to style flags, which do not change during a widget's lifetime,
  there are also dynamic widget states a theme can refer to.
  To do so, use the CSS attribute syntax:
</p>

<pre><code>  Button:hover {
    ...
  }
</code></pre>

Attributes and states can be mixed freely. For example, the following selector
applies only to buttons that have the style flags <code>SWT.PUSH</code>
<strong>and</strong> <code>SWT.BORDER</code> <strong>and</strong> are currently
in state <code>hover</code>:

<pre><code>  Button[PUSH][BORDER]:hover {
    ...
  }
</code></pre>

<p>
  The styles and states that a theme can refer to depend on the widget and are
  also listed in the <a href="../reference/theming/index.html">theming reference</a>.
</p>

<h4>Widget Variants</h4>

<p>
  Normally, a theme setting affects all widgets of a given type equally.
  By defining widget variants it is possible to apply an individual presentation
  to particular widgets without affecting all widgets of that type.
  As an example, imagine an application that uses buttons in a special banner bar.
  These buttons should have a different font and text color than normal buttons.
  By making these buttons part of a variant (e.g. &quot;mybutton&quot;), you can define
  separate CSS rules for these widgets.
</p>

<p>
  To implement this, the buttons in the banner bar are marked as belonging to a
  custom variant (e.g. &quot;mybutton&quot;) in the Java code using SWT widget data:
</p>

<pre><code>  button.setData( WidgetUtil.CUSTOM_VARIANT, &quot;mybutton&quot; );
</code></pre>

<p>
  In the theme CSS file, these widget variants can be referred to using the
  <em>class</em> notation known from CSS used for HTML:
</p>

<pre><code>  Button.mybutton {
    ...
  }
</code></pre>

<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>
  The themeable properties are also widget specific.
  Not all RWT widgets are equally customizable, some already provide a large
  set of themeable properties, others are still more hard-wired.
  An overview of all available elements and their themeable CSS properties can
  be found in the
  <a href="../reference/theming/index.html">theming reference</a>.
  As well as the properties itself, also the syntax for the property values is
  a subset from CSS.
  It is also documented in the reference.
</p>

<h3>Precedence in CSS</h3>

<p>
  If more than one rule applies to a given element, property values defined in
  one rule can overwrite those in another rule.
  The precedence of rules and properties is defined in the CSS specification.
  In short, it is defined by the specificity of a rule and its position in the
  CSS file.
  Please refer to the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#specificity">CSS specification</a>
  for a detailed description.
</p>

<h3>Setting SWT Defaults</h3>

<p>
  The SWT classes Display and Device contain methods that return default system
  colors, a system font, and system images.
  In RAP, these defaults are also controlled by the theme.
  For details, see the theme reference of the Display element.
