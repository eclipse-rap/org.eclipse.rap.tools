  <h1>Server Push</h1>

  <p>
    Sometimes it's necessary to “push” UI updates from the web server to the browser client.
    As an example, imagine a chat application that notifies the user of a chat request from a peer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Usually, the UI is updated in the UI thread as a result of a user interaction, e.g. in a
    listener.
    These updates are processed during request processing, so that the ui changes are immediately
    rendered in the response.
    But when the UI is updated from a background thread using Display.asyncExec() while the user
    is idle, there's no request that could fetch the ui updates from the server.
  </p>
  <p>
    But HTTP is not designed to push data to the client.
    An HTTP server can only answer reqests from a client, but it cannot actively send any message
    to the client.
    There are basically two different approaches to tackle this problem, polling and Comet.
  </p>

  <h2>Polling</h2>

  <p>
    The simple approach is to make the client issue requests at a steady interval.
    If any changes have occured to the UI on the server, the server will send the UI updates in
    response.
  </p>
  <p>
    The implementation is simple in RAP.
    The client needs to schedule a timer that sends an empty request to the server.
    The server will send any pending UI changes in response.
    The JavaScript code to enable polling looks like this:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  String code =   &quot;window.setInterval( function() {\n&quot;
                + &quot;  org.eclipse.swt.Request.getInstance().send();\n&quot;
                + &quot;}, 20000 );&quot;; // polling interval in ms
  JSExecutor.executeJS( code );
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Please note that this code makes use of internal API which may change without notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    The polling approach may be an option when updates doesn't have to come timely.
    The shorter the interval, the more network load is added by sending unneccessary requests
    frequently.
  </p>

  <h2>Comet (UI Callback)</h2>

  <p>
    With the so-called Comet approach, the server is able to notify the client <em>immediately</em>
    without the need for frequent requests.
    The basic idea is that the client sends a special “callback” request to the server.
    This request is not answered by the server, so the client keeps waiting for a response.
    When the server needs to notify the client of a change, it sends a response to the standing
    request and asks the client to call back.
  </p>
  <p>
    RAP provides an implementation of this mechanism which is called UI callback.
    Before starting a background task, the UI callback can be activated by calling:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  UICallBack.activate( "my unique id" );
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    This has to be done from the UI thread, since otherwise the activation cannot be transferred to
    the client anymore.
    The id passed to the activate method is only needed to identify the caller.
    After the background task has completed and the UI callback is no longer needed, it should be
    deactivated using the same id:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  UICallBack.deactivate( "my unique id" );
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    When different instances require the UI callback at the same time, only one standing request
    will be opened by the client.
    The UI callback system is deactivated when the last instance has called deactivate.
  </p>
  <p>
    More technical details of the UI callback implementation can be found on the
