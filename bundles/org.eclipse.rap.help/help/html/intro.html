  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    The Rich Ajax Platform (RAP) is a framework for modular, web-based business applications. 
    User interfaces can be developed entirely in Java using a widget toolkit with
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt">SWT</a> API, JFace, and databinding.
    They can, but do not have to use the Eclipse Workbench and Eclipse extension points.
    Existing RCP applications can be run as Web applications with only minor changes.
