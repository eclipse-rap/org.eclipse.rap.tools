  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    The Rich Ajax Platform enables developers to build rich, Ajax-enabled Web applications by using
    the Eclipse development model.
    User interfaces can be developed using a widget toolkit with
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt">SWT</a> API,
    JFace, and databinding.
    Applications can be composed of OSGi bundles and also use the well known Eclipse extension points.
    They even can, but do not have to use the Eclipse Workbench.
    As an effect, existing RCP applications can be run as Web applications with only minor changes.
