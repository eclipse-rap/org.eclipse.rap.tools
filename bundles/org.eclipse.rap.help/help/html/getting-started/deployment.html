  <h1>How to deploy a RAP application to a servlet container?</h1> 
  
  <p>The current eclipse build tools and wizards do not directly support 
  building this style of application so for the time being the build can be
  performed with a series of Ant scripts and resource templates. The 
  <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo.feature</code> shows how to create a <code>WAR</code> that
  contains the <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo</code> project as RAP application.</p>
  
  <p>Note: As with RCP applications there are a wide variety of possible
  configurations. What's given in <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo.feature</code> is just
  one possibility.</p>
  
  <p>As prerequisites we assume that you are familiar with the bundles- and 
  build information section of the 
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/server/http_in_container.php">
  Equinox in a Servlet Container</a> document. We also assume that you have a 
  checkout of the 
  <a href="servletbridge-anon.psf">servlet bridge bundles</a>
  in your workspace. <b>Note</b>: This is configured to build and run against
  the 3.2 code base of equinox. If you are working with 3.3 use the team project
  set for the servlet bridge that is available  
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/server/downloads/servletbridge-anon.psf">here.</a></p>
  
  <h3>Prepare the build script</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>If not already done checkout the <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo.feature</code>
  project into your workspace.</li>
  <li>Open the <code>script/webappBuilder.xml</code> with the Ant editor.</li>
  <li>Adjust the <code>servletbridge.dir</code> property
  (see docu in script file).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Create the build content</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Right-Click on the <code>webAppBuilder.xml</code> script in the IDE and 
      "Run Ant". (Note: In order to make the <code>pde.exportFeatures</code> task
      available in the IDE select "Run in the same JRE as the workspace" on the
      JRE tab from "Run Ant..").</li>
  <li>Refresh the feature project - a build folder should appear. (Note:
      The <code>pde.exportFeatures</code> target will build the plug-ins
      asynchronously and may take a while till finished. After that the complete 
      <code>WAR</code> content should be available in the build folder.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Adjust the <code>config.ini</code></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Adjust the path to the plugin directory of your build in the
  <code>ConfigIniCreator</code> (see docu in <code>ConfigIniCreator</code> 
  class).</li>
  <li>Run the ConfigIniCreator as java application.</li>
  <li>Copy the console output to the <code>config.ini</code> file of your
  build.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="../../images/config.png">
  
  
  <p>After that pack the <code>WAR</code> of the application build available in the 
  build folder (in our case the content of <code>build/rapdemo</code>). Deploy
  the <code>WAR</code> to a servlet container to see whether the build was successful :-)</p>

  <h2>How to deploy my own application?</h2>
  
  <p>To deploy your own application like described above you will have
  to create your own feature. The feature should contain the same plug-in 
  references as the demo feature (except the demo-plug-in of course!) plus the
  plug-ins that make up your application. It is important that your plug-ins that
  reference the servlet API use the <code>Import-Package</code> header to do 
  this (see <code>MANIFEST.MF</code> of the demo project).</p>
  
  <p>Copy the script and templates folder to the feature and modifiy them
  according to your project structure. Following the steps above should lead
  to a full functional <code>WAR</code> of your application.</p>
