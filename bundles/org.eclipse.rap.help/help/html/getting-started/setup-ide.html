  <h1>Setting up the Eclipse IDE</h1>
  <p>
    To get started, you will first need to set up an Eclipse IDE with the <strong>RAP Tools</strong>
    installed. You can choose between downloading an Eclipse IDE package with RAP Tools included or
    getting RAP Tools separately and installing them into your existing IDE.
  </p>

  <h2>Download an Eclipse IDE package with RAP Tools included</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rap/downloads/">Download page</a>
  </p>

  </div>
  <p>
    This screencast shows how to get started with developing RAP applications.
    It covers RAP target installation, creating a new RAP application and
    launching it in a web browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Get RAP Tools separately and install them into your existing Eclipse IDE</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rap/downloads/">Download page</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you rather want to use an existing Eclipse IDE, you can also get the RAP Tools
    separately and install them as a plug-in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      With Eclipse up and running, select the <strong>Help</strong> &gt;
      <strong>Install New Software ...</strong> menu entry.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enter enter the RAP Update Site URL
      <strong>http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/1.5/tooling</strong>
      into the <strong>Work with</strong> field and press Enter.
    </li>
    <li>
      After a short while, an entry labelled <em>Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)</em> appears
      in the list below. Select its check box and click <strong>Next</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      On the the next page you may review the installation details.
    </li>
    <li>
      Accept the terms in the license agreement and click the
      <strong>Finish</strong> button.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature and plug-ins will now be downloaded from the repository and
      installed locally.
    </li>
    <li>
      Confirm the following prompt to restart Eclipse.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="target-install">Use the RAP Tools to install the latest target platform</h2>
  <p>
    RAP applications need to be compiled against the RAP runtime.
    To do so, the runtime needs to be set as the target platform in Eclipse.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Eclipse starts on a fresh workspace, a welcome page is displayed.
    Select the <strong>Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)</strong> section and
    choose <strong>Install Target Platform</strong> on the following page.
    In the upcoming dialog confirm the default values, which starts the target
    installation process.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the installation finished you are prepared to work with RAP.
    For your first steps you may read the
    <a href="examples.html">RAP Examples</a>
    topic and/or the other chapters of the getting started section.
