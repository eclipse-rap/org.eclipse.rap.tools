  <h1>Setting up the Eclipse IDE</h1>
  <p>
    To get started, you will first need to set up an Eclipse IDE with the <strong>RAP Tools</strong>
    installed. The most convenient way to get the RAP Tools is using the 
    Eclipse package <q>for RCP and RAP Developers</q> from the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse download page</a>. 
    This IDE includes everything you need to develop RCP and RAP applications, and
    you can get right to installing the <a href="target-install.html">target platform</a>...
  </p>

  <h2>Installing RAP Tools into an existing Eclipse IDE</h2>
  <p>
    If you rather want to use an existing Eclipse IDE, you can also get the RAP Tools
    separately and install them as a plug-in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      With Eclipse up and running, select the <strong>Help</strong> &gt;
      <strong>Install New Software ...</strong> menu entry.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enter enter the RAP Update Site URL
      <strong>http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/1.5/tooling</strong>
      into the <strong>Work with</strong> field and press Enter.
    </li>
    <li>
      After a short while, an entry labelled <em>Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)</em> appears
      in the list below. Select its check box and click <strong>Next</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      On the the next page you may review the installation details.
    </li>
    <li>
      Accept the terms in the license agreement and click the
      <strong>Finish</strong> button.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature and plug-ins will now be downloaded from the repository and
      installed locally.
    </li>
    <li>
      Confirm the following prompt to restart Eclipse.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can also get the RAP tools from the RAP <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rap/downloads/">Download page</a>.
