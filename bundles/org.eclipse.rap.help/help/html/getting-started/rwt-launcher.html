<h1>Launching RWT Applications</h1>

<p>The simplest way to launch an RWT application is to run it using an RWT Application launch 
  configuration. This launch configuration type uses information derived from the workbench 
  preferences and your applications's Java project to launch the program. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the <strong>Package Explorer</strong>, select the Java compilation unit or class file 
    with the entry point you want to launch.</li> 
  <li>Press the <strong>Run</strong> [<img src="../../images/run.png" />] button in the workbench 
    toolbar or select <strong>Run > Run</strong> from the workbench menu bar. Alternatively, select 
    <strong>Run As > RWT Application</strong> in the Package Explorer pop-up menu, or select 
    <strong>Run > Run As > RWT Application</strong> in the workbench menu bar, or select 
    <strong>Run As > RWT Application</strong> in the drop-down menu on the Run tool bar button.</li>
  <li>The application is now launched. A browser will be opened for you to interact with the 
    application.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also launch an RWT application by selecting a project instead of the compilation unit 
  or class file. You will be prompted to select a class from those classes that define an entry
  point. If only one class with a main method is found in the project, that class is launched as 
  if you selected it.
</p>
<p>How the generated launch configuration can be altered, you can read in the topic 
  <a href="create-rwt-launch-config.html">Creating an RWT Application launch configuration</a>.</p>
