<h1>RAP Examples</h1>

<p>Note: This chapter assumes that you have downloaded the latest RAP Taget 
Platform. The download and instructions on how to install it are available 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rap/downloads.php">here</a>.</p> 

<p>There are two kinds of example types available.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Templates</h3>
    
    <p>To create a RAP plug-in from a template open a the new project 
    wizard (File -> New -> Project) and select Plug-in Project. Type a 
    project name (e.g. mail) and click next. Ensure on the following page
    that the plug-in option 'This plug-in will make contributions to the UI' is
    selected and the no rich client application will be created. Click next. Now
    you should see a page where you can select a template. Select one of the 
    templates with the RAP prefix (e.g. RAP Mail). Click finish.</p>
    
    <p>The plug-in comes with a preconfigured launch configuration. Open
    the Run dialog (Run -> Open Run Dialog), select the 
    <a href="launcher.html#rap">RAP Launch Configuration</a> that matches your 
    project name (e.g. mail) and click run to start.</p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Demo Plug-in</h3>
    <p>The RAP project comes with two example applications demonstrating the 
    features and capabilities of RAP.</p>

    <p>The first application provides a workbench very closely aligned to the
    RCP workbench. The second demo shows what widgets there are and that 
    they behave very similar to the SWT widgets.</p>

    <p>To access and run these demo applications, please open the Plug-ins view 
    (e.g. through the Plug-in Development perspective). Select the plug-in named 
    <strong>org.eclipse.rap.demo</strong> which contains both demo applications, 
    right-click on this plug-in and select <strong>Import as &gt; Source Project
    </strong>.
    This plug-in will then appear with all source files in your workspace. The 
    demo also provides a ready-to-use <a href="launcher.html#equinox">Equinox 
    Launch Configuration</a>.</p>

    <p>After launching, you can access the workbench demo using the 
    URL <strong>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/rap?startup=default</strong>. To 
    try the controls demo pass a parameter in the URL like this: 
    <strong>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/rap?startup=controls</strong>.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
