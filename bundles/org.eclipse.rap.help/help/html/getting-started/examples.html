  <h1>RAP Examples</h1>
  
  <p>
    Note: This chapter assumes that you have downloaded the latest RAP Runtime SDK.
    The download and instructions on how to install it are available
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rap/downloads/">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>There are two kinds of example types available.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Templates</h3>
      
      <p>
        To create a RAP plug-in from a template, open the <strong>New Project</strong> wizard
        (<strong>File > New > Project</strong>) and select <strong>Plug-in Project</strong>.
        Type a project name (e.g. mail) and click <strong>Next</strong>.
        On the following page, ensure that the option
        <strong>This plug-in will make contributions to the UI</strong>
        is selected and no <strong>Rich Client Application</strong> will be created.
        Click <strong>Next</strong>. Now you should see a page where you can select 
        a template. Select one of the templates with the RAP prefix (e.g. RAP Mail). 
        Click <strong>Finish</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The plug-in comes with a preconfigured launch configuration.
        Open the Run dialog (<strong>Run > Run Configurations...</strong>), select the
        <a href="launcher.html#rap">RAP Launch Configuration</a> that matches your 
        project name (e.g. mail) and click <strong>Run</strong> to start.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Demo Plug-in</h3>
      <p>
        The RAP project comes with two example applications demonstrating the features and
        capabilities of RAP.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The first application provides a workbench very closely aligned to the RCP workbench.
        The second demo, referred to as the 'controls demo', shows what widgets there are and that
        they behave very similar to the SWT widgets.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        To access and run these demo applications, please open the Plug-ins view
        (e.g. through the Plug-in Development perspective).
        Select the plug-in named <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo</code> which contains both demo
        applications, right-click on this plug-in and select
        <strong>Import as &gt; Source Project</strong>.
        This plug-in will then appear with all source files in your workspace.
        The demo also provides a ready-to-use
        <a href="launcher.html#equinox">Equinox Launch Configuration</a>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        After launching, you can access the workbench demo using the URL
        <code>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/rap?startup=default</code>.
        To try the controls demo enter the following URL:
        <code>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/rap?startup=controls</code>.
      </p>

  </ul>
