<h1>Demo Application</h1>

<p>The RAP project comes with two example applications demonstrating the 
  features and capabilities of RAP.</p>
<p>The first application provides a workbench very closely aligned to the RCP 
  workbench. The second demo shows what widgets there are and that 
  they behave very similar to the SWT widgets.</p>

<p>To access and run these demo applications, please open the Plug-ins view 
  (e.g. through the Plug-in Development perspective). Select the plug-in named 
  <strong>org.eclipse.rap.demo</strong> which contains both demo applications, 
  right-click on this plug-in and select <strong>Import as &gt; Source Project
  </strong>.
  This plug-in will then appear with all source files in your workspace. The 
  demo also provides a ready-to-use launch configuration.</p>

<p><strong>If you are using Eclipse 3.3</strong>, you need to start 
  the <code>org.eclipse.equinox.app</code> plug-in with your RAP demo. To do 
  so, switch to the <strong>Plug-ins</strong> tab of your Launch Configuration 
  and select to include the <strong>org.eclipse.equinox.app</strong> plug-in.</p>
  
<p>For Max OS X systems, please add <strong>-Djava.awt.headless=true</strong> 
to your VM arguments.</p>

<p>To run the demo, select <strong>Run &gt; Run...</strong> from the main menu.
  In the upcoming Launch Configuration Dialog, select <strong>Rich Ajax Platform 
  Demo</strong> from the section <strong>Equinox OSGi Framework</strong>.</p>

<p>You may want to configure the TCP-port your demo application will listen to. 
  This is done opening the <strong>Arguments</strong> page and changing the 
  <strong>-Dorg.osgi.service.http.port=9090</strong> VM argument, to a 
  (arbitrarily chosen) port your application will listen to. This is 
  particularly important if the default port 9090 is already taken by some 
  other application.</p>

<p>To actually start your demo, click the <strong>Run</strong> button. The 
  correct startup should display in the Eclipse Console through a message 
  saying <code style="color:red">INFO: Started SocketListener on 
  0.0.0.0:&lt;port&gt;.</code> If an error shows up, please make sure all other 
  instances are stopped and then retry with another port.</p>

<p>Now that the RAP demo application is running, you can access it using any 
  browser. Please enter the URL <strong>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/rap</strong>.
  <p>

<p>The rap demo application defines two entry points. The default is the 
  workbench demo. You can now select the controls-demo by explicitly passing a
  parameter in the url like this: 
  <strong>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/rap?startup=controls</strong>.
  The controls demo will show you all the widgets that come with RWT and 
  how they work just like SWT in a browser.</p>

<p>Have fun with your RAP demo and enjoy experimenting with your own projects, 
  and please let us know how you like it. If you have any questions, comments 
  or remarks, please also don't hesitate contacting the RAP Team through 
  <a href="http://eclipse.org/rap">the project web site</a>. We will appreciate 
  any feedback.</p>
