<h1>Demo Application</h1>

<p>The RAP project comes with two example applications demonstrating the 
  features and capabilities of RAP.</p>
<p>The first application provides a workbench very closely aligned to the RCP 
  workbench. The second demo shows what control widgets there are and that 
  they behave very similar to the SWT widgets.</p>

<p>To access and run these demo applications, please open the Plug-ins view 
  (e.g. through the Plug-in Development perspective). Select the plugin named 
  <strong>org.eclipse.rap.demo</strong> which contains both demo applications, 
  right-click on this plugin and select <strong>Import as &gt; source project
  </strong>.
  This demo will then appear with all source files in your workspace. The 
  demo also provides a ready-to-use launch configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> that even though importing the demo project as
  source succeeds, the plug-in can only be run if You installed the SDK release.
  When using the Update-Manager to get RAP, the <strong>Rich Ajax Platform SDK
  </strong> component must also be checked as shown below.
</p>

<p>To run the demo, select <strong>Run</strong>. In the upcoming Launch 
  Configuration Dialog, select <strong>Rich AJAX Platform Demo</strong> from 
  the section <strong>Equinox OSGi Framework</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Important note for Eclipse 3.3:</strong><br/>
  If you are using Eclipse 3.3. already, you need to start the 
  <strong>org.eclipse.equinox.app</strong> plugin with your rap demo. To do 
  so, switch to the <strong>Plug-ins</strong> tab of your Launch Configuration 
  and select to include the <strong>org.eclipse.equinox.app</strong> plug-in.
  </p>

<p>You may want to configure the TCP-port your demo application will listen to. 
  This is done opening the <strong>Arguments</strong> tab and passing 
  <strong>-Dorg.osgi.service.http.port=10080</strong> as an argument to the 
  Java Virtual Machine (VM), where 10080 is the (arbitrarily chosen) port your 
  application will listen to. This is particularly important if the default 
  port 80 is already taken by some other application (e.g. your Web Server ...) 
  or in an environment where you are not allowed to access privileged ports 
  (e.g. as a non-admin user on some operating systems).</p>

<p>To actually start your demo, click the <strong>Run</strong> button. The 
  correct startup should display in the Eclipse Console through a message 
  saying <code style="color:red">INFO: Started SocketListener on 0.0.0.0:&ltport&gt;.</code> 
  If an error shows up, please make sure all other instances are stopped and 
  then retry with another port.</p>

<p> Now that the rap demo application is running, you can access it using any 
  browser. Please enter the URL <b><i>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/rap</b></i>.
  <p>

<p>The rap demo application defines two entry points. The default is the 
  workbench demo. You can now select the controls-demo by explicitly passing a
  parameter in the url like this: <br/>
<b>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/rap?w4t_startup=controls</b></p>
    
<p>The controls demo will show you all the widgets that come with RWT and 
  how they work just like SWT in a browser.</p>

<p>Have fun with your RAP demo and enjoy experimenting with your own projects, 
  and please let us know how you like it. If you have any questions, comments 
  or remarks, please also don't hesitate contacting the RAP Team through 
  <b>http://eclipse.org/rap</b>. We will appreciate any feedback.</p>
