  <h1>Installing a RAP Target</h1>
  
  <h2 id="target-install">Using the RAP Tools to install the latest target platform</h2>
  <p>
    RAP applications need to be compiled against the RAP runtime.
    To do so, the runtime needs to be set as the target platform in Eclipse.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Eclipse starts on a fresh workspace, a welcome page is displayed.
    You can also get to the welcome page choosing <i>Welcome</i> from the <i>Help</i> menu.
    Once there, click <strong>Overview</strong> and select the <strong>Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)</strong> section.
    Choose <strong>Install Target Platform</strong> on the following page.
    In the upcoming dialog confirm the default values, which starts the target
    installation process.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the installation finished you are prepared to work with RAP.
    For your first steps you may read the
    <a href="examples.html">RAP Examples</a>
    topic and/or the other chapters of the getting started section.
  </p>

  <h2>Install Target Manually</h2>
  <p>
    You can also install a target manually, e.g. if you want to develop against a different
    version of RAP or combine RAP with other bundles.
    To select a target platform you can either use the Target Platform preferences page
    (<em>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Plug-in Development &gt; Target Platform</em>) or create
    a <em>target definition file</em>.
    The latter is preferable, as target definition files can be checked in into your source code
    repository and shared among team members.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      First, you may want to create a project to host your target definition files.
      A plain project will do (<em>File &gt; New &gt; General &gt; Project</em>).
    </li>
    <li>
      In this new project, create a new target definition:
      <em>New &gt; Plug-In Development &gt; Target Definition</em>.
      Chose a name like <em>rap-custom.target</em> and press <em>Finish</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The target editor will open and show the contents of this target definition.
      Now, add the RAP runtime from a p2 repository a.k.a. software site:
      press <em>Add</em>, select <em>Software Site</em>.
      You'll be confronted with another dialog, named <em>Add Software Site</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Again press <em>Add</em> and enter the URL of the RAP runtime repository.
      You find these URLs on the RAP <a href="http://eclipse.org/rap/downloads/">download page</a>,
      e.g.
      <ul>
        <li>
          for RAP 1.4: http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/1.4/runtime
        </li>
        <li>
          for RAP 1.5: http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/1.5/runtime
        </li>
      </ul>
      Hint: You can also install the RAP runtime directly from a download zip archive.
      In this case, press <em>Archiveâ€¦</em> and select the zip file.
    </li>
    <li>
      For a basic RAP target, select the category <em>Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)</em>.
      This category contains two features:
      The RAP runtime itself (<em>RAP Target Components</em>),
      and a set of Eclipse bundles needed for a basic RAP target (<em>Basic Target Requirements</em>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Before you click <em>finish</em>, make sure the checkbox
      <em>Include required software</em> is <em>not</em> checked.
    </li>
    <li>
      Activate the target platform by clicking the link <em>Set as Target Platform</em> in the
      upper right corner of the target definition editor.
    </li>
  </ol>
