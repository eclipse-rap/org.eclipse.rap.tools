<h1>Creating an RWT Application launch configuration</h1>

<p>When you choose <strong>Run > Run As > RWT Application</strong> to launch your entry point, 
  you are running your application using a generic RWT Application launch configuration that 
  derives most of the launch parameters from your Java project and your workbench preferences.
  In some cases, you will want to override the derived parameters or specify additional arguments. 
</p>

<p>
  To create an RWT Application launch configuration from scratch or alter an existing one, select
  <strong>Run > Run Configurations...</strong> or <strong>Run > Debug Configurations...</strong>
  from the workbench menu bar. This opens a dialog that lets you create, modify, and delete launch 
  configurations of different types. To create a new RWT Application launch configuration, select 
  <strong>RWT Application</strong> in the left hand list of launch configuration types, and press 
  the <strong>New</strong> button in the toolbar. The tabs on the right hand side allow you control 
  specific aspects of the launch.
</p>

<p>On the <strong>Main</strong> tab you can control the following aspects of the launch:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>project</strong> field denotes the project that contains the entry point to 
    launch. You do not have to specify a project, but doing so allows a default classpath, source 
    lookup path, and JRE to be chosen.</li>
  <li>
  </li>The <strong>Application entry point</strong> lets you specify what should be launched.
    For simple use cases it is recommended to choose <strong>Run entry point class</strong> and
    specify the class that implements the <code>org.eclipse.rwt.lifecycle.IEntryPoint</code> 
    interface in the class name field.
    <br />
    If you whish to have more control or even would like to run an arbitrary web aplicatiom, 
    select <strong>Run from web.xml</strong> and enter the path to the web.xml in the location 
    field. The servlet path should point to one of the servlets defined in the web.xml and is 
    used to construct the URL to be opened with the browser.    
  <li>The <strong>browser</strong> group lets you control whether the application should be 
    opened with the internal browser in the editor area or with an external browser or if no 
    browser should be opened at all.
    The outcome depends on the browser preference settings that can be reached with the 
    <strong>Configure browsers...</strong> link.
  </li>  
  <li>It is recommended to let the launcher dynamically choose a free port for 
    client-server communication. However if you would like to have full control 
    over the communication channel, you can enable <strong>Manual Port Configuration</strong>
    and explicitly specify a port number.</li>
</ul>

<p>For an explanation of the other tabs see the topic
  <a href="/help/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/tasks-java-local-configuration.htm">
  Creating a Java application launch configuration</a>
</p>

<p>When an RWT Application launch configuration is launched, it first terminates any possibly 
  running launch that shares the same launch configuration.</p>
