  <h1>Writing a Hello World with RAP</h1>

  <h2>Preconditions</h2>
  <p>
    It is recommended to install the <a href="http://eclipse.org/rap/downloads/">RAP Tooling</a> into your IDE.
    You can either download the Eclipse package named “Eclipse for RAP and RCP Developers” or
    install the RAP Tooling into your Eclipse from the Eclipse repositories.
    If you read this article inside Eclipse, then you obviously have the RAP Tooling installed
    already.
  </p>
  <p>
    To develop RAP applications, you have to install a RAP target platform.
    The target platform contains the bundles that all your workspace projects are compiled against.
    You can check your current target in the Eclipse Preferences under <em>Plug-in Development &gt;
    Target Platform</em>.
    The RAP Tooling can assist you to install a RAP target platform.
    On the Welcome page (<em>Help &gt; Welcome</em>) navigate to the RAP page (<em>Overview &gt;
    Rich Ajax Platform</em>) and select <em>Install RAP Target Platform</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>Create the application</h2>
  <h3>A new project</h3>
  <p>
    First we need a project for our application.
    From the menu, select <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em>.
    When the <em>New Project</em> wizard appears select <em>Plug-in Project</em> from the section
    <em>Plug-in Development</em>.
    Let's call the plug-in <code>org.example.rap.helloworld</code>.
  </p>
  <img src="../../images/hello-world/NewProject-1.png"/>
  <p>
    On the second page of the wizard, disable the options
    <em>Generate an activator, …</em> and
    <em>This plug-in will make contributions to the UI</em>.
    The first one would create a bundle activator, but we don't need that now.
    The latter would add dependencies for RCP apps, but they don't fit for RAP.
  </p>
  <img src="../../images/hello-world/NewProject-2.png"/>

  <h3>Add dependencies</h3>
  <p>
    Now we add a dependency to the <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui</code> plug-in.
    This bundle is the RAP equivalent of <code>org.eclipse.ui</code>.
    It “re-exports” all bundles you need for developing Eclipse applications, including SWT and
    JFace.
    Later, you can (and you should) be more specific on your dependencies, but for now, this is the
    easiest way.
  </p>
  <p>
    To add this dependency, open the project's bundle manifest file
    <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code>.
    In the <em>Plug-in Manifest Editor</em>, go to the <em>Dependencies</em> page.
    Add <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui</code> to the list of <em>Required Plug-ins</em> and save.
  </p>

  <h3>Create a package</h3>
  <p>
    Before creating any Java code you should create a package.
    The main package of the bundle should always match with the bundle id, to avoid split packages.
    Therefore, name the package <code>org.example.rap.helloworld</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Create an entrypoint</h3>
  <p>
    Your application needs an entrypoint, a method that is called by the framework when a user
    starts the application.
    To do so, we need a class that implements the interface <code>IEntryPoint</code>.
    Alternatively, it is also possible to implement the Eclipse-specific interface
    <code>IApplication</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's start with the more general <code>IEntryPoint</code>.
    We create a class named <code>EntryPoint</code> that implements <code>IEntryPoint</code>.
    In the method createUI, we create some SWT code.
    You can generate the skeleton of this code using an SWT template (type <em>main</em> and hit
    Ctrl+Space, then select the template named <em>mainloop</em>).
    In the example below, we added a Button with the text “Hello world!”:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  public class EntryPoint implements IEntryPoint {

    public int createUI() {
      Display display = new Display();
      Shell shell = new Shell( display );
      shell.setLayout( new GridLayout( 1, false ) );

      Button button = new Button( shell, SWT.PUSH );
      button.setText( "Hello world!" );

      shell.pack();
      shell.open();
      while( !shell.isDisposed() ) {
        if( !display.readAndDispatch() ) {
          display.sleep();
        }
      }
      display.dispose();
      return 0;
    }
  }
  </code></pre>

  <h3>Register the entrypoint</h3>
  <p>
    To make RAP aware of this entrypoint, it has to be registered with an extension point.
    In the <em>Plug-in Manifest Editor</em>, go to the <em>Extensions</em> tab and create a new
    extension for the extension point <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui.entrypoint</code>.
    Select the created entrypoint class as value for the <em>class</em> attribute.
    Also specify a concise value for the <em>parameter</em> attribute such as <em>myapp</em>.
    We'll need this parameter later to access the appliation.
  </p>

  <h2>Launch the application</h2>
  <p>
    That's it, we are now ready to run the application.
    Here's the short version:
    <em>Run &gt; Run configurations…</em>, create a new <em>RWT</em> launch configuration, select
    your project and entrypoint class and press <em>Run</em>.
    A browser view should open up soon afterwards and show your running application.
    More on launching RAP applications in the next article.
