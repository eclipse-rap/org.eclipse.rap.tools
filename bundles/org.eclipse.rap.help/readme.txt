toc.xml

The table of contents of the help plugin (help/toc.xml) may contain several
entries about non-existing files. The most of them can be found in the
"Reference" category. The referenced html files will be generated at build time.

See "org.eclipse.rap.releng.tooling" for more informations how these files are
generated during the automated build.
